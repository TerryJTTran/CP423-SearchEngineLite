aneurysmsIf must major surgery best news get learn minimally invasive one means tiny—or no—incisions far less pain speedy recovery instead dramatic procedure requires surgeons open body exactly news Yale patients getting diagnosed thoracoabdominal aneurysm TAAA weakening walls aorta chest abdomen TAAA complex deadliest type aneurysm far handful centers United States treat TAAAs minimally invasive surgery Yale one places pioneer unique approach “In major way endovascular surgery TAAAs last frontier surgery aortic aneurysm﻿” says Naiem Nassiri MD﻿ vascular surgeon introduced new approach Yale performed dozen procedures less year “It completely revolutionized care patients complex thoracoabdominal aneurysm also means part longer need aneurysm patients undergo massive surgeries” Dr Nassiri collaborates TAAA surgeries cardiothoracic surgeon Prashanth Vallabhajosyula MD﻿ director Aortic Institute part Yale New Health Heart Vascular Center unique platform used Yale Unitary Manifold—a modular physicianassembled branched stentgraft system invented Patrick Kelly MD Sanford Health South Dakota Yale Medicine surgeons say using particular stentgraft platform combining two different skill sets—cardiothoracic vascular—have contributed strong record successful outcomes Dr Nassiri Dr Vallabhajosyula answered questions procedure minimally invasive approaches transforming aneurysm careWhat thoracoabdominal aneurysm difficult treatAortic aneurysm disease 12th leading cause death US aneurysm develop anywhere along aorta—the body’s major blood vessel carries blood heart chest abdomen organs aortic aneurysms occur either chest abdomen TAAA occurs areas therefore requires extensive surgery places “The entire aorta get aneurysmal meaning becomes weakened dilated enlarged” Dr Vallabhajosyula says isn’t solid data show frequently occurs complex often lethal adds Surgeons repair TAAAs reach 5560 cm 2 inches less diameter risk rupture reasons surgery might also needed including genetic predisposition rapid growth tears aorta unexpected configurations aneurysm onset symptoms TAAAs like aneurysms often don’t symptoms imminent risk rupture death reason people don’t know one unless identified imaging another condition don’t seek medical attention becomes emergency sudden severe chest back painWhat unique new surgery thoracoabdominal aneurysmMinimally invasive surgeries﻿ aortic aneurysms endovascular meaning performed within arteries Surgeons use wires catheters—thin tubes used engaging various blood vessels respective branches—as well Xray andor ultrasound guidance deliver stentgrafts disease site Stentgrafts metal mesh networks various configurations fabric sewn onto Placed inside aneurysmal aorta block blood flow reaching pressurizing aneurysm thereby eliminating blood flow within aneurysm sac causing “clot off” prevents aneurysm expanding cases shrink completely areas affects TAAA calls complex stentgraft system deployed across area aorta branches supplying critical organs including liver intestines kidneys aorta locations cannot treated simple stentgraft—it would cut blood supply critical organs Instead stentgrafts cover aortic aneurysm maintain blood flow vital branches “Quality life also immensely better new procedure Many ready go home within 72 hours operation” says Yale Medicine vascular surgeon Naiem Nassiri MDThe Unitary Manifold stentgraft configuration used Yale Medicine technique called Endovascular Debranched Aortic Repair EDAR currently “Breakthrough Device” designation﻿ Food Drug Administration FDA program provides timely access certain new medical devices speeding development assessment review Unitary Manifold system unique design stent cover weakened aorta used alone combination aortic stentgrafts Sewn stent four branches allow blood flow critical abdominal organs including kidneys intestines stomach liver spleen pancreas device cuts blood flow aortic aneurysm maintaining blood flow four vessels Dr Vallabhajosyula explainsHow endovascular surgery aneurysm performedThe operation involves two needle punctures groin physicianassembled Unitary Manifold compressed tube delivered punctures via guidewire threaded femoral artery aorta deployed four branches flowered open Another small incision made underarm surgeons insert thread deliver individual endovascular bypass grafts Unitary Manifold’s four branches supplying blood abdominal organsHow endovascular approach different open operationThe new operation dramatic improvement patients explains Dr Vallabhajosyula biggest change reduced trauma body open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair involves cutting open body cavities manipulating lungs diaphragm muscle mobilizing moving aside kidneys intestines placing clamps aorta cutting open sewing synthetic graft replace sewing individual bypasses individual organs done incision goes side back across ribcage navel require cutting open diaphragm muscle even removing ribs Traditional open TAAAs high rate complications including paraplegia death procedure “patients would require days weeks even months hospital” Dr Nassiri says “They would intensive care unit ICU extended time significantly blood loss propensity organ injuries” Patients survived operation would describe feeling “like hit bus” says never fully regain quality lifeWhy cardiac vascular surgeons work together endovascular procedureMany studies shown multidisciplinary approach makes difference patient outcomes Dr Vallabhajosyula explains “I believe it’s crucial” says Even advantages endovascular approach collaboration provides TAAA patients stronger safety net adds “These aneurysms complex think every single detail planning procedure” Dr Vallabhajosyula says “It automatically gives patients two minds—two experts—working together”What benefit using Unitary Manifold stentSimilar stent systems investigated TAAAs Unitary Manifold advantage able mold different anatomies systems access four vessels differently using holes instance designs limited ability fit different anatomies patients have—to point many able surgery using platforms Unitary Manifold straightforward “It require customization would take three four weeks—or beyond—to prepare require strict anatomic criteria Therefore much broader flexible” Dr Nassiri says Another benefit device makes possible “stage” major surgery meaning surgeon stop given point necessary continue later date without redo work Dr Vallabhajosyula explains crucial benefit doctors might want stop surgery reduce risk paraplegia major concern open operation “We continuous monitoring brain spinal cord” says “If point see concerns might want stop give patient time build collateral blood supply” “In addition Unitary Manifold platform used conditions aortic dissections tears treat patients previous open endovascular aortic repairs didn’t work failed time” Dr Nassiri saysIs endovascular procedure better patients health issues“These aneurysms complex think every single detail planning procedure automatically gives patients two minds—two experts—working together” says cardiothoracic surgeon Prashanth Vallabhajosyula MD working vascular surgeon endovascular procedureFor medical issues aortic disease minimally invasive surgery may best option—in fact may one “With aging population example large subgroup people 60s 70s 80s require complex repair would never survive open surgery told nothing done need seek hospice comfort measures” Dr Nassiri says endovascular approach might solution group adds Open surgery also highrisk people chronic lung problems due smoking poor kidney function weak heart “With endovascular platform able take care patients much less strain body” Dr Vallabhajosyula says Patients open aortic operation may need breathing tube days weeks cases breathing tube never comes explains contrast many endovascular procedure tube removed still operating table Quality life also immensely better Dr Nassiri adds patients may stay one two days ICU monitoring “Many ready go home within 72 hours operation” Dr Nassiri saysHow surgery transforming aneurysm care generalEndovascular surgery TAAAs isn’t available everywhere Yale Medicine surgeons expect time colleagues around country learn technique procedures however best performed largevolume tertiary referral centers access collaborative multidisciplinary infrastructures one Aortic Institute Yale explains Dr Nassiri “Endovascular procedures newergeneration endografts significant way replaced open aortic surgery practice” Dr Nassiri says “In experience patients longer need undergo massive surgeries” “It’s gamechanger” says Dr Vallabhajosyula “Time tell us longterm outcomes right looking perspective treating highrisk sick patients may alternatives palliative care imagine option means them”Read Yale Medicine newsRelated SpecialistsSameer NagpalMDInterventional Cardiology Cardiovascular MedicineEdouard AboianMDVascular
