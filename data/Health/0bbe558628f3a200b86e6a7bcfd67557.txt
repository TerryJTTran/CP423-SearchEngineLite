shown COVID19 vaccines prevent COVIDrelated hospitalization death What’s vast majority 11 million deaths COVID19 US people 50 older numbers increase age according CDC data Still 424 people 65 older—and 167 eligible people US—have gotten first bivalent shot according CDC “I consider number quite poor” Dr Roberts says part bigger plan FDA also announced current bivalent mRNA vaccines replace original monovalent Moderna PfizerBioNTech mRNA COVID19 vaccines target original ancestral SARSCoV2 virus strain longer authorized use US agency also planning simplify future COVID19 vaccinations offering reformulated booster vastly expanded age group fall around time flu shot becomes available booster based recommendations current circulating SARSCoV2 virus strains Dr Roberts answered common questions FDAs decision offer additional COVID19 booster certain groups1 get additional COVID19 booster ­­­It depends CDC recommends everyone 6 years age older receive updated bivalent mRNA COVID19 vaccine regardless whether previously completed monovalent primary series you’re age 6 older already received updated mRNA vaccine don’t need take action unless 65 older immunocompromised﻿ 65 older eligible additional bivalent booster primary COVID19 vaccine least four months previous bivalent booster shot also eligible additional booster two months last shot moderately severely immunocompromised meaning you’re organ transplant recipient receive immunosuppressive medications treatments chemotherapy﻿ you’re certain medications weaken immune system time corticosteroids weakened immune system due medical condition cancer﻿ selfattest immunocompromised status means need documentation get COVID19 vaccine doses eligible receive according CDC FDA also allows additional doses immunocompromised people “at discretion intervals determined health care provider” 2 additional dose bivalent vaccine allowed certain groupsOlder immunocompromised people vulnerable severe disease hospitalization death COVID19 vulnerability growing concern bivalent boosters first offered last fall already showing decline effectiveness April study published New England Journal Medicine showed bivalent booster offered last fall provided added protection severe illness death COVID19 waned time also showed older adults immunocompromised much vulnerable hospitalization death COVID19 young healthy people Another consideration older people’s bodies mount less robust immune response COVID19 even vaccinated “This true many types vaccines also true viruses respiratory syncytial virus infection﻿ RSV influenza﻿” Dr Roberts says “It makes age one greatest risk factors negative outcome terms infectious diseases COVID” 3 changes COVID vaccination affect childrenBecause monovalent original mRNA COVID19 vaccines longer authorized use US unvaccinated children 6 months 4 years age may receive threedose primary series PfizerBioNTech bivalent vaccine unvaccinated 6 months 5 years age may get twodose primary series Moderna bivalent vaccine Children abovementioned age groups already received one two three doses monovalent COVID19 vaccine may get bivalent shot number doses receive depend type vaccine Moderna Pfizer they’ve already received age vaccination history 4 you’ve never vaccinated COVID19Most unvaccinated people eligible single dose bivalent COVID vaccine rather multiple primary doses original monovalent mRNA vaccines 5 vaccinated Novavax Johnson Johnson vaccineFor majority people CDC recommends PfizerBioNTech Moderna Novavax boosters vaccines Johnson Johnson

COVID19 cases US “However doesn’t mean booster won’t protect XBB15 new Omicron variants may arise” Dr Roberts says XBB15 still Omicron offshoot know bivalent booster effective Omicron subvariants Dr Roberts explains CDC study January assessed bivalent vaccine introduced last fall effectiveness Omicron subvariants XBB XBB15 people previously received two four monovalent vaccine doses Scientists found updated booster’s realworld effectiveness symptomatic infection first three months vaccination strains similar BA5 “If immunity variant exposed new offshoot you’ll protection” Dr Roberts says 8 additional bivalent booster allowed ‘recommended’ immunocompromised people 65 older“The CDC giving people option” says Dr Roberts Although recommending vaccine eligible patients given authorization second bivalent booster mixed reviews example experts challenging additional booster brought what’s called “immune imprinting” theory says keep boosting older COVID variants could turning immune response’s focus older variants longer circulating future boosters target newer variants may generate robust response Dr Roberts explains “However that’s hypothetical area concern havent seen play yet data” Dr Roberts says “Most data supports boosters effective” says “They good job boosting immune response current variants” 9 get COVID19 bivalent boosterAs previous COVID19 vaccines booster
