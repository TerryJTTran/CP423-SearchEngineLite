patient’s quality lifeIn late 2020 Lewis Popper’s memory cognition began fade retired attorney volunteered various organizations near home Northampton Mass could longer think straight simple task like setting alarm clock confounded “I didn’t answers whatever questions front worse couldn’t even figure start thinking questions” Popper recalls troubles also physical active hiker could clamber steep hills group he’d started seniors Popper became breathless easy walks time confident stride turned weak shuffle early 70s otherwise good health normal aging wife consulted various specialists one could figure early February 2021 went see geriatrician watching walk physician certain rare condition called normal pressure hydrocephalus ﻿NPH disorder primarily affects men women 60 brain overproduces cerebrospinal fluid CSF extra fluid brain puts pressure brain cells damages lead variety mental physical symptoms surgical treatment NPH geriatrician staff wellregarded hospital thought late Popper symptoms become significant Popper’s grown children researched condition obtained name someone told could help father Charles Matouk MD﻿﻿ neurosurgeon Yale Medicine Normal pressure hydrocephalus difficulttodiagnosis conditionDr Matouk first met Popper telehealth appointment early March 2021 director Yale Medicine Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Program﻿ Dr Matouk stranger problems Popper experiencing CSF explains plays important role bodies “CSF serves cushion brain doesn’t bump hard box skull” says “It also provides mechanism nutrients get brain make CSF constant rate get rid constant rate too” However someone normal pressure hydrocephalus CSF builds “We tend think much problem much made problem enough able get out—as pipes blocked” Dr Matouk says 700000 Americans NPH less 20 properly diagnosed cause unknown difficult diagnose Adults NPH typically three symptoms difficulty walking cognitive impairment including trouble making decisions slowed thinking urinary incontinence walking troubles Dr Matouk describes someone unstable feet “They can’t catch balance easily gait could described magnetic” says “The stride length shortens feels like can’t pick feet floor brain communicating legs provide stability gait quality” three main NPH symptoms common elderly population makes NPH difficult diagnose Dr Matouk adds “Plus many reasons someone might able walk well might bad knee bad hip arthritis back take symptom isolation 20 30 population age 75 80 form gait instability” Dr Matouk says “And true mild cognitive issues urinary frequency common men women age” Unfortunately Dr Matouk says take long time—sometimes years—to properly diagnose NPH “And time patients continue decline” says “If get patients late theyre going experience much improvement treatment might symptoms caught earlier” Popper Dr Matouk’s first virtual meeting decided Popper come New full evaluationSpinal tap lumbar drain trial Two ways diagnose normal pressure hydrocephalusBrain scans adult NPH usually show large CSF ventricles ultimate test diagnose NPH spinal tap two ways One what’s called large volume lumbar puncture also known spinal tap “The fluid brain CSF connected fluid spine place needle back withdraw fluid spine we’re actually withdrawing brain” Dr Matouk explains “We remove large amount water see patient’s symptoms improve next hours” testing method NPH lumbar drain trial entails placing drain spine leaving three days remove fluid continuously “This mimics effects traditional surgical treatment would NPH place shunt brain remove fluid” says “And done longer hours better see there’s improvement symptoms” type testing combined dedicated NPH program found hospitals US “I consider lumbar drain trials gold standard determining whether someone would benefit shunt treatment NPH” says “This kind testing requires large number people administer Patients admitted intensive care unit ensure right amount—not much—of fluid drained Daily assessments physical therapists occupational therapists track objective subjective metrics also videotape analysis see whether theres improvement quality someones gait respond different questions” end three days testing team family meet discuss whether improvement—and improvement justifies risks surgery would next step treatment “We dont want subject someone older medical conditions put higher risk surgical procedure unless good chance improve symptoms says Dr Matouk “With lumbar drain trial relatively certain we’re going see improvement symptoms surgery—and also degree symptoms improve gives people confidence deciding whether move forward surgery” end Popper’s trial late March enough improvement noticed given option shunt surgery wife decided itSuccessful surgery normal pressure hydrocephalusThe surgery planned next day Typically patients come trial Monday surgery done end week discharge takes place weekend “In terms neurosurgery it’s relatively simple procedure” Dr Matouk says “Several small incisions made head abdomen Next surgeon drills hole skull catheter plastic tube placed inside brain connected shunt shunt creates bypass—or another channel fluid exit fluidfilled center brain long plastic tube flows peritoneum inner lining abdomen natural ability absorb fluid” surgery takes 40 minutes Patients walking pretty quickly procedure discharged within 24 48 hours says Lauren Danis APRN﻿﻿ works Yale NPH Program Since Popper’s surgery Yale become involved clinical trial minimally invasive NPH surgical treatment﻿Recovery surgery requires physical therapy“The shunt first step recovery disease think difficult part comes surgery patients work hard physical therapy” Danis says “Before shunt weren’t making progress NPH cause muscle weakness contributes difficulties walking surgery however physical therapy help retrain vestibular system also build strength” Lewis Popper hiking successful surgery normal pressure hydrocephalus I’m still grateful do” saysPhysical therapy done office home patients deconditioned point need go shortterm rehab Popper’s case nurse physical therapist occupational therapist visit home “Very soon surgery could ask answer questions much clearly 10 days later wife feeling becoming less alert worried her” Popper says Dr Matouk said come visit surgeon performed appeared Popper magic trick Dr Matouk held magnet Popper’s skull adjust shunt drained CSF brain “Our shunts adjustable One size doesnt fit patients need little bit drainage others takes 10 seconds do” Danis explains “It almost acts floodgate first surgery put shunt floodgate cracked draining much fluid Mr Popper good response that—just floodgate cracked made adjustment realized needed fluid drained” Popper quickly experienced improvements “My thinking pretty soon went back people say way used might still take little longer get joke complicated things like legal analyses little harder follow” Popper says “But it’s also hard us know that’s age remainder NPH Physically rebuilding strength walk 2 3 miles forest I’m longer 5 miles climbing boulders like used I’m still grateful do”Read Yale Medicine newsMore news Yale MedicineFamily
