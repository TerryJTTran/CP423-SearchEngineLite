Health8 Things Know Surgery Rectal CancerBY KATHY KATELLA March 2 2023Why early diagnosis mean better quality lifeOriginally published Feb 28 2022 Updated March 2 2023 Rectal cancer cancer nobody wants talk need conversation becoming urgent Combined colon cancer it’s third common cancer United States diagnoses rising year people younger 50 American Cancer Society predicts US 2023 46050 new cases rectal cancer common younger people older people importantly though reassuring news outlook getting better rectal cancer—if it’s diagnosed spreads fiveyear survival rate 89 “Rectal cancer treatable disease” says Vikram Reddy MD PhD MBA chief colon rectal surgery Smilow Cancer Hospital works colon rectal surgeon Anne Mongiu MD PhD among others treat high volume cases many complicated One piece promising news came June 2022 reports small clinical trial drug called dostarlimab resulted rectal tumors vanishing 14 people enrolled researchers continue follow participants abnormality called “mismatch repair deficiency” occurs 5 10 rectal cancer patients trial published June 2022 New England Journal Medicine many patients still need surgical treatment rectal cancer cases doctors say outcomes also tend quite good “I patients followed 5 years say ‘Things good dont worry stop seeing us’” Dr Reddy says surgeons say fewer issues procedure patients get early diagnosis—which it’s important talk doctor quickly possible changes bowel habits particular concern narrow stools blood stools feeling bowel isn’t emptying completely colorectal cancer symptoms many feel uncomfortable idea talking doctors symptoms fear COVID19 infection means fewer people screening colonoscopies seeing doctors concerns Dr Reddy explains “Were seeing lot cases advanced rectal cancer pandemic” says “If there’s bleeding may assume it’s hemorrhoids theyre willing see doctors pandemic many people screening exams aren’t getting them” problem rectal cancer time advance greater chance spread body advanced rectal cancer higher likelihood patients need chemotherapy radiation addition surgery often need stoma—a pouch collect waste hole abdominal wall Sometimes stoma permanent sat Drs Reddy Mongiu discuss 8 things need know rectal cancer 1 Colorectal cancer refers cancer occurs anywhere colon rectumWhen think colorectal cancer may helpful understand entire area Within large intestine colon 5 feet long rectum 6 inches anus Stools liquidy form colon solidify rectum stored temporarily 2inchlong anal canal made two anal sphincters pelvic floor muscles controls passing stoolPolyps form colon rectum colonoscopy considered “goldstandard” colorectal cancer screening procedure gastroenterologists remove polyps find pathologist determine whether polyp cancerousIn cases digital rectal exam even primary care provider quickly find problem Dr Mongiu says fewer doctors perform exam—unfortunately adds—because many patients could diagnosed earlier “It done every patient part routine physicals—just screening—because could catch something thats early even bothering yet”2 don’t need right colorectal surgeon—you need teamIf need rectal surgery Dr Reddy recommends finding colorectal surgeon high volume rectal surgery need likely best outcomes fewer issues sexual bowel function surgery less chance colostomy “Sometimes it’s best ask surgeon ‘How many month—or year’” says “You find someone 50 year”Dr Mongiu agrees “Much like tying shoe going run complex surgeries musclememory procedures better someone high volume them” saysIts also important select colorectal surgeon done fellowship colon rectal surgery differentiates general surgeonsBut it’s surgeon—it’s getting care center multidisciplinary team Dr Mongiu adds “Its lot better go place academic medical center care interconnected” says “Every time one patients rectal cancer sees oncologist get note know treatments going helps prepare”3 Colorectal surgeons use MRI enhance surgeryIf get rectal cancer diagnosis may help know recent years brought significant improvements care example colorectal surgeons use magnetic resonance imaging MRI gather important information MRI enables accurately assess size tumor pinpoint location within rectum well close anatomical structures turn helps surgical planning reduce likelihood recurrence surgical complications MRI help colorectal surgeons see much cancer invaded rectal wall even lymph nodes fat around rectum also removed surgery says Dr Mongiu information guides called “total neoadjuvant therapy”—shrinking tumor chemotherapy radiation surgery minimize surgery required adds“In small percentage patients cancers completely disappear get chemotherapy radiation” Dr Reddy says4 Robotic surgery means precise surgical work less time hospital“Robotic surgery gamechanger us” says Dr Reddy still open laparoscopic operations almost rectal surgeries performed Yale robotic ones adds patient surgery mean three four small incisions belly robot makes less painful explains “Even patients heavier comorbidities makes surgery little easier”In robotic surgery rather operating directly patient surgeon sits console near patient manipulates robotic surgical tools watching monitor Robotic surgery allows doctors precise also provides better visualization rectum difficult area operate narrow portion body thin walls nearby nerves important urination sexual function Dr Reddy says rectum located close prostate men vagina women bladder Also additional challenge trying protect anal sphincters“Rectal surgery recurrence rates fallen roughly 20 cases 1990 less 5 today” says Vikram Reddy MD PhD MBA chief colon rectal surgery Yale Medicine colon rectal surgeon performing robotic surgery threedimensional sense greater stabilization instruments surgery without robot Dr Reddy explains “The visualization unbelievable zoom look closely nerves making easier preserve them” saysFor patients robotic surgery meant less pain surgery often cuts length hospital stay would otherwise five days three addsStudies also shown lower incidence nerve injury robotic surgery Dr Reddy says combination presurgical tumor treatment robotic surgery also lowered risk permanent stoma many patients Dr Mongiu addsYet another benefit robotic surgeries don’t create scar tissue within abdomen occur traditional open surgery rectal cancers—scar tissue would put young women risk infertility Dr Reddy adds 5 Two types rectal surgery require incisions allWhile minimally invasive rectal surgeries performed incisions abdomen two newest procedures don’t involve incisions Several years ago Dr Reddy started performing difficult procedure called transanal endoscopic microsurgery TEMS minimally invasive robotic surgery uses special equipment including freestanding laparoscope anoscope TEMS surgeon inserts specialized instruments anus remove earlystage cancerous lesions newer procedure used small earlystage cancers transanal minimally invasive surgery TAMIS allows many patients go home day done robotically instruments inserted port anus“Sometimes polyps gastroenterologist excised colonoscopy incidental cancer found” says Dr Mongiu “So go back take samples section wall rectum send pathology theres residual cancer—or clear rest residual tumor—that’s needs done” says6 Success rectal surgeries depends multiple factorsIt’s difficult gauge success rectal surgeries One consideration “local recurrence rate”—if patient local recurrence means surgery precise enough cancer cells left behind “Rectal surgery recurrence rates fallen roughly 20 cases 1990 less 5 today” says Dr Reddy vary widely based number factors says adding patient different every rectal cancer size stage colorectal surgeon’s experience makes differencePatients likely recurrence perforated obstructing cancers rare phenotype called mucinous rectal cancers Dr Reddy says “But patients recurrence rate low”7 Fewer patients permanent stomasPermanent stomas less common used According United Ostomy Associations America Inc currently 725000 1 million people US ostomy surgery allows bodily waste pass stoma—an estimate includes rectal ostomies cancer causes patients may temporary one patients stoma rectal surgery“For us absolute criteria right leads patients permanent stoma tumor invading anal sphincter” Dr Reddy says sphincter must removed isn’t anything replace addsRobotic surgery helping even situations preserving anus impossible says Dr Mongiu “The robot makes easy get lower rectal tumors—even bottom rectum” saysAfter surgery rectal cancer patients taken hospital floor nurses specialized knowledge procedure Additionally certified ostomy nurses visit inpatients teach care temporary permanent stoma appropriately“We try simplify ostomy care eventually becomes part daily routine starts teaching surgery continues inpatient stay subsequent outpatient followup care Taking care stoma simple adding another thing todo list” says Jennifer Giannettino MSN Yale Medicine nurse practitioner works ostomy program“Much like tying shoe going run complex surgeries musclememory procedures better someone high volume them” says colon rectal surgeon Anne Mongiu MD PhDUltimately people adapt quite well adds “There learning curve challenging patients making inpatient outpatient coaching important part care symptomatic cancer it’s welcome change patients takes little coaching”A stoma shouldn’t interfere person’s regular activities variety products help “People ostomies fully participate life’s activities swimming sports hobbies” Giannettino says “But careers activities may best supported additional accessories”For instance people ostomies develop hernias go back jobs involve heavy lifting get hernia belts protect explains People ride motorcycles go rock climbing—activities could risk falling stomach—can get titanium covers protect stoma Yale providers worked schoolteachers airline pilots others able continue careers lifestyles appropriate support saysEven don’t ostomy rectal surgery bowel movements change says Dr Reddy compares rectum body’s trash “If part rectum removed trash becomes smaller” says “What end happening patients go bathroom four five times day sometimes go go” Certain foods may trigger symptoms improve take year adds8 Care education rectal cancer surgery make differenceRectal surgery different patient surgery lower rectum complex take six seven hours it’s upper rectum take little two hours“The whole treatment overwhelming” says Maggie Guerrero APRN cares colorectal patients outside hospital Patients might see multiple providers—in addition several doctors see nutritionist enterostomal therapy nurse social worker“Our goal provide individualized care” Guerrero says involve lot discussion since many patients come preconceived ideas talking family friends “We take breath say ‘This journey It’s good get information bring back us don’t get overwhelmed’ help patients successful treatment”Meanwhile Dr Mongiu involved development—and related research—of presurgery program help people strengthen muscles involved bowel movements functional surgery “There rather complicated muscular neural dance squeeze contract certain muscles” says “This program would allow patients pelvic floor physical therapy privacy homes—and lot less upfront cost going see physical therapist” saysIn end one afraid hesitant seek care symptoms Giannettino says Doctors start scheduling routine colonoscopies screen colorectal cancer starting age 45—or earlier suspect problem “If get checked learn something don’t afraid proceed treatments need Giannettino says You’re alone things manageable resources help” Read Yale Medicine newsRelated SpecialistsVikram ReddyMD PhD MBAColorectal SurgeryIra LeedsMDColorectal Surgery Inflammatory Bowel Disease Minimally
