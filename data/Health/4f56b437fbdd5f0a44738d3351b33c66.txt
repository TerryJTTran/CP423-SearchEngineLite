safe baby mother experience typical side effects opioid drowsiness occur opioid taken orally given via IV epidural hurtBefore epidural administered you’ll receive numbing injection much like would dentist cavity filling “That initial injection lower back hurt little women feel pain—just pressure epidural needle inserted” Dr McGuire saysWhen feel pain relief epiduralPain relief begin 15 minutes receiving epidural takes 10 minutes administer It’s important note epidural last long woman labor Dr McGuire adds explaining medication delivered continuously it’s time deliver point labor receive epiduralA woman get epidural almost time labor remain relatively still however epidural generally given baby close delivered women heard need dilated meaning cervix opens preparation birth certain amount epidural given However according guidelines American College Obstetricians Gynecologists ACOG request mother sufficient “There isn’t minimum cervical dilation done epidurals one centimeter woman fully dilated 10 centimeters” Dr McGuire says common concern epidural early labor slows labor delivery “There evidence slow 20 minutes half hour grand scheme things much time” Dr McGuire says move around receiving epiduralUsually women stay bed receiving epidural decreased sensation legs puts risk falling However able move legs move around bed Dr McGuire explainsAre epidurals safeEpidurals safe medical procedure small risks side effects complications Serious risks—including blood clots inside spine infection around spine brain nerve damage—are rare possible complications include low blood pressure itchy skin headaches Blood pressure baby mother constantly monitored labor goes far either blood pressure medication administered intravenously mother help baby Additional risks include
