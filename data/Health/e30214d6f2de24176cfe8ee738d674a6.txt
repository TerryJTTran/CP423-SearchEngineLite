transient ischemic attack TIA temporary blockage blood flow part brain also known ministroke middle dinner started saying things made sense knew wanted say friends couldn’t get right words friends decided dinner drove hospital Fortunately symptoms lasted hour permanent damage according emergency department doctors effect ministroke lifechanging later I’ll start beginning 2006 40s diagnosed type 2 diabetes chronic disorder body unable properly use insulin resulting high blood glucose levels elevated levels lead number serious health issues they’re managed properly—often difficult task condition Diabetes patients physicians find right balance medication diet exercise maintain good blood sugar levels without letting get high low dangerous ministroke November 2021 diabetes doctors say completely “uncontrolled” lifelong love affair sugar ate much ice cream candy carbohydrates wanted despite knowing diabetic behavior would affect blood glucose levels felt fine blessed good health life hindsight guess trying prove diabetes going change anything Even worse diet fact didn’t take medications regularly figured eating badly anyway point I’ve come learn you’ll read diabetes insidious disease without symptoms years feel completely fine complications diabetes start take hold—and eventually will—they affect virtually every area health That’s excessive sugar blood damaging blood vessels nerves throughout body three common complications diabetes involve damage nerves neuropathy eyes retinopathy kidneys nephropathy according Renata Belfort De Aguiar MD PhD Yale Medicine endocrinologist treats patients diabetes well organtransplanted patients develop condition result poor diabetes management ended three complicationsFrom tingling feet eye injectionsThe first diabetes symptom felt began around 2010 mild tingling “pins needles” feeling feet time gradually worsened became numbness portions feet condition known peripheral neuropathy results damage nerves located outside brain spinal cord half people diabetes develop type neuropathy Many experience sharp stabbing pains feet I’m fortunate I’ve never Ive experienced numbness cold feet due diabetesrelated circulation problems neuropathy never really bothered rationalized could easily live little numbness feetThe really worrisome complications diabetes started six years ago routine dilated eye exam told beginnings diabetic retinopathy advised see retina specialist soon possible I’ve always squeamish eyes put retreated familiar world denial one autumn evening year later dinner outdoors friend said “Look stars—there’s Big Dipper” looked saw black sky stars scared finally went retina specialist sure enough time fairly advanced retinopathy Diabetic retinopathy occurs much sugar blood leads blockages tiny blood vessels nourish retina lightsensitive tissue back eye result vessels start leak fluid cases close completely eye attempts grow new blood vessels new vessels dont develop properly leak bleed easily lead buildup fluid called edema macula—the center portion retina left untreated macular edemas cause permanent vision loss Sometimes laser treatments used stop slow leakage eye Another treatment involves injecting medications eye help stop growth new blood vessels decrease fluid buildup told injections would best option sensitive eyes never even worn contact lenses faced prospect literally getting needles eyes thanks topical anesthesia numbs eye kind retina specialist wasn’t bad getting injections several years it’s gotten easier time It’s amazing get used especially alternative potentially going blind Gastroparesis—another warning signIn addition developing neuropathy eye problems hospitalized twice within sixmonth period 2017 2018 uncontrolled vomiting throwing relentlessly every five 10 minutes even longer food stomach never received definitive diagnosis cause—according doctors—was likely gastroparesis condition stomach empty properly Gastroparesis occur high blood sugar damages enteric nervous system governs functions gastrointestinal tract Digestion slows food stays body longer Symptoms include heartburn nausea vomiting abdominal bloating feeling full quickly eatingThe two times hospitalized uncontrolled vomiting came blood sugar levels around 500 mgdl extremely high Desired blood sugar levels diabetics 100 fasting first thing morning 180 one two hours meal main way clinicians monitor longterm blood sugar control hemoglobin A1C test measures average blood sugar level past three months sugar enters bloodstream attaches hemoglobin protein red blood cells A1C test measures percentage red blood cells sugarcoated hemoglobin higher A1C higher likelihood developing complications diabetes diabetics goal A1C 7 time diabetes A1C level 1314 range occasionally even higher reflecting average blood sugar level 325350Each time hospitalized doctors told playing fire high A1C levels extremely dangerous believed vowed change absolutely meant would feel stressed anxious angry sad moment Ben Jerry’s New York Super Fudge Chunk ice cream important longterm consequences diabetes “I need relief now” told “and still plenty time get act together lower A1C last sugar binge tomorrow start taking care myself” hundreds “last binges” gradually destroying health Peripheral neuropathy amputation—a real possibilityRemember said little numbness feet didn’t bother Turns wrong tooThe danger peripheral neuropathy don’t feel pain feet may foot injury infection realize Damage blood vessels caused high blood sugar slows blood flow feet increasing odds small injuries become infected also slows wound healing summer 2020 attending annual family gathering upstate New York noticed small cut toe washed put Neosporin slapped BandAid forgot weeks later friend pointed left foot bleeding turned foot discovered large open wound underside big toe clearly infected—the open part wound yellowishgreen toe red swollen “That must really hurt” friend said didn’t feel anything Even though still fully grasp gravity situation went local urgent care center soon doctor nurse saw infected toe could tell looks faces serious one point doctor used scalpel cut away dead skin around wound warned would hurt seemed shocked didn’t even flinch—I couldn’t feel thing treated strong antibiotics told see podiatrist soon possible appointment doctor examined toe said jokingly “It’s like I’m going toe amputated right” shocked said “Amputation real possibility We’ll wait see” infection spread bone explained would probably lose toe took series Xrays luckily infection spread bone help tough love family friends finally realized didn’t change ways would invalid—or dead—within short time says Barbara Steinberger—the author article—on struggles diabetes managementBut woods told significantly lower blood sugar levels wound toe would never heal never healed toe would likely—eventually—have removed addition wearing special boot treating foot podiatrist prescribed started eat right take medications monitor blood sugar regularly miraculously toe started heal first time seen dramatic example “cause effect” came blood sugar good news toe made complete recovery bad news toe completely healed went back old ways eating taking medications regularly diabetes ‘wakeup calls’I many “rockbottom” moments since first diagnosed diabetes somehow getting injections eyes almost losing big toe still weren’t enough motivate make longterm changesMore wakeup calls came 2021 early 2022 first involved muscle loss number years legs gradually becoming weaker walked—especially stairs hills—my legs would burn intense workout problem compounded lower back pain summer 2021 walking mailbox painful walk longer became impossible I’ve always loved walking along country lanes near summer cottage couldn’t even walk neighbor’s house talked primary care doctor never occurred problem could anything diabetes turns could several diabetesrelated causes including decline skeletal muscle mass known diabetic myopathy Another possible cause could peripheral artery disease circulatory problem narrowed arteries reduce blood flow legs Making things worse fact balance problems felt unsteady result neuropathy feet last November ministroke combination finding difficult walk finally scared core help “tough love” family friends finally realized didn’t change ways would invalid—or dead—within short time completely changed diet took medications directed started seeing therapist help food issues biggest shock still come Kidney disease rockbottom momentWhile hospital ministroke given diagnosis acute kidney injury AKI referred nephrologist felt sure onetime incident caused dehydration primary care doctor mentioned past elevated protein levels urine hospitalization never seemed like urgent situationAfter conducting urine blood tests nephrologist informed chronic kidney disease CKD complication occurs high blood sugar damages tiny blood vessels act filters kidneys time kidneys lose filtering ability Worse yet later found stage 4 kidney disease stage 5 kidney failure kidneys fail would require either kidney transplant dialysis procedure remove waste products excess fluid blood kidneys longer perform functions Diabetes leading cause kidney failure according Dr Belfort De Aguiar stunned Kidney damage cannot reversed try keep getting worse addition controlling blood sugar prescribed number medications lower blood pressure potassium levels contribute progression kidney disease avoid high potassium foods like bananas tomatoes avocados oranges nephrologist said would work try avoid dialysis least put long possible cases stage 4 kidney disease eventually progresses stage 5 Perhaps greatest blow came nephrologist referred evaluation see would suitable candidate kidney transplant walls denial came crashing overwhelmed seriousness situation “A kidney transplant I’m ready that” told explained take average seven years get donated kidney deceased organ donor may never need transplant it’s best start process soon possible evaluation learned it’s actually preferable get kidney living donor possible generally last longer find embarking another journey one never would envisioned looking kidney donor Living well diabetesLooking back wish taken diabetes seriously taken control blood sugar lot soonerBut considering everything lucky didn’t sustain permanent damage ministroke still fairly good vision thanks eye injections still toes heart seems good shape alive things extremely grateful price paid many years poor diabetes management take ridiculous number medications weeks multiple medical appointments lowsugar lowsalt lowpotassium diet still trouble walking probably getting injections eyes rest life there’s good chance require dialysis andor kidney transplant future recent A1C test 72—by far lowest it’s ever huge improvement 136 A1C hospital ministroke next test I’m hopeful A1C 7 recommended level people diabetes I’ve seven months good blood sugar control 15 years poor diabetes management it’s start I’m taking things one day time taking measure comfort knowing feels like finally take care Read Yale Medicine newsMore news
