see doctor symptoms prevent prostate problem prostate cancer main cause prostate cancer Prostate Health prostate gland isnt big—about size walnut—but location virtually guarantees problems something goes awry prostate gland located bladder front rectum also wraps around upper part urethra tube carries urine bladder body means prostate problems affect urination sexual function prostate prone three main conditions Prostatitis infection inflammation prostate Benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH agingrelated enlargement prostate gland Prostate cancer growth cancerous cells inside prostate may break gland affect parts body Articles Result View Prostate function prostate prostate plays key role reproduction Although it’s testicles produce sperm prostate along tiny neighboring organs called seminal vesicles helps produce semen—the viscous fluid sperm travel Here’s happens ejaculate Within prostate series ducts lined fluidproducing cells pushes prostatic fluid urethra tube carries urine bladder joins sperm produced testicles fluids generated seminal vesicles narrow glands located side prostate prostate consists two lobes right left it’s wider base base prostate higher body gland nestles bladder “apex” lower end closer rectum apex base lies midgland terms important discussions prostate cancer since area prostate cancer appears affect symptoms treatment options outcomes common prostate problems Unfortunately men experience kind prostate problem lifetime Prostate problems generally associated three conditions prostatitis BPH cancer Prostatitis refers inflamed prostate two main types acute prostatitis chronic prostatitis Acute prostatitis caused infection usually bacteria results sudden onset painful urination small stream often fever chills Chronic prostatitis also known chronic pelvic pain syndrome less well defined condition symptoms include persistent recurrent pelvic discomfort pain burning urination increased urge urinate difficulty emptying bladders andor painful ejaculation underlying cause chronic inflammation without infection often exact reason symptoms can’t found Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia BPH commonly called “enlarged prostate” refers excessive growth gland usually occurs age 50 double triple mass latter decades life BPH caused cancer though occur alongside itBPH considered expected part aging process men half cases asymptomatic men experience problems prostate expands size effectively pinches urethra tube carrying urine bladder penis making muscular walls bladder work harder causing problems urination cancers prostate cancer abnormal growth cells Prostate cancer localized limited prostate regionally advanced spread surrounding tissue metastatic spread distant sites Recent years seen great advancements prostatecancer screening testing treatment causes prostate problems Acute prostatitis usually caused bacterial infection exact cause chronic prostatitischronic pelvic pain syndrome often discovered One possibility immune system mistakenly targets prostate blasting gland inflammatory compounds Another possibility bacterial fungal infections go undetected standard testing methods Certain foods may also trigger symptoms might stress depression chronic pain conditions trauma genitourinary area repeated biopsies far greatest risk factor benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH enlarged prostate age However prostatitis sedentary lifestyle obesity high blood pressure diabetes associated condition researchers found correlations BPH diet high sugar red meat refined grains exact cause prostate cancer identified although genetic defects either inherited uninherited play key role Age important risk factor family history Men whose fathers brothers prostate cancer two three times likelier get Race appears matter well—rates among African Americans 60 higher white men diet high red meat saturated fats associated increased risk obesity separate risk factor studies suggest men ejaculate infrequently higher risk develops prostate problems common men live old age develop form prostate problem although symptoms range mild inconvenience like get night urinate invasive cancers cause debilitating changes even death 9 16 men develop prostatitis inflamed prostate point lives Unlike prostate problems prostatitis affects younger older men equally year prostatitis leads nearly 2 million doctor visits US Men suffering depression anxiety stress may struggle prostatitis symptoms men chronic pain conditions may susceptible Prostatitis contagious Benign prostatic hyperplasia BHPor overgrown prostate extremely common older men Although majority men condition 5060 never develop symptoms remainder seek treatment range problems weak urine stream frequent urge urinate waking night use bathroom leaking dribbling large prostate may cause urinary obstruction inability empty bladder American Cancer Society estimates 268490 men diagnosed prostate cancer 2022 34500 dying making second leading cause cancer deaths among men US Still 98 men survive 10 years diagnosis 96 survive 15 years often prostate cancer lowgrade stays localized within prostate Low grade cancers usually affect quality life lead early death challenge identify aggressive cancers early stage African Americans greater risk prostate cancer especially aggressive forms group US symptoms prostate problems Acute prostatitis caused bacteria may cause symptoms typical infections fever chills fatigue muscle pain may also pain difficulty urinating Chronic prostatitischronic pelvic pain syndrome characterized group symptoms including frequent urge urinate burning pain urination inability empty bladder pain difficulty ejaculating pain pelvis lower back perineum area scrotum rectum men report feeling fullness rectum blood may appear semen forms prostatitis cause spasming pelvicfloor muscles Although observable symptom patient prostatitis increase blood levels prostatespecific antigen PSA hallmark BPH benign prostatic hyperplasia enlarged prostate cluster symptoms known acronym LUTS lower urinary tract symptoms include weak interrupted urine stream frequent urination especially night frequent urge urinate leaking dribbling feeling can’t quite empty bladder time symptoms may escalate point bladder longer push urine past obstructing prostate causing what’s known acute urinary retention inability urinate painful true medical emergency damage kidneys BPH also raise PSA levels normal range prostate cancer diagnoses come patients reporting symptoms rather blood tests show high PSA levels followed biopsy Patients lowrisk nonaggressive cancers typically experience symptoms men notice signs cancer symptoms tend difficulty urinating bone back pain cancer spread see doctor symptoms Talk doctor experience lower urinary tract symptoms LUTS include weak urine stream increased urgency urinate inability void bladder completely frequent urination symptoms prompt doctor’s visit persistent recurrent pain ejaculation blood semen pain around base penis perineum lower back rectum symptoms related enlarged prostate BPH doctor weigh risks versus benefits treatment major consideration extent symptoms interfering lifestyle example work office need travel frequently use bathroom often probably disruptive lifestyle way wouldn’t retired worked home symptoms prevent engaging enjoyable activities they’re noticeably worsening discussing treatment options doctor wise gauge severity symptoms completing simple sevenquestion multiplechoice questionnaire get what’s called International Prostate Symptom Score IPSS You’ll asked questions “Over past month often push strain begin urination” “Over past month often weak urinary stream” Based responses you’ll able tally overall score falls range moderate severe talk doctor treatment unable urinate you’re experiencing medical emergency seek prompt urgent care prevent prostate problem Since causes prostate problems unknown think terms lowering risk rather preventing problems Certain lifestyle considerations associated lower risk enlarged prostate prostate cancer include maintaining healthy body mass exercising eating Mediterraneanstyle diet often used screening method detect prostate cancer PSA prostatespecific antigen test However many conditions besides cancer might cause elevated PSA score PSA tests often produce falsepositive results current recommendation consider pros cons screening discuss doctor still questions PSA screening lead excessive unnecessary biopsies potential overtreatment prostate cancer cancers begin cells somewhere body start grow control Prostate cancers get start prostate gland may spread body parts cancer remains limited prostate known localized prostate cancer found low grad cancer biopsy often immediate treatment necessary Periodic monitoring determine cancer still growing Intermediate high grade localized cancer treated surgery radiation therapy Men don’t surgery might also treated hormonal therapy called androgen deprivation therapy ADT block production testosterone key hormone promotion cancer growth main cause prostate cancer single cause prostate cancer identified—nor researchers conclusively state given factor causes disease per se Inherited genetic changes sometimes identified DNAdamaging chemicals environment may play role Radiation chemicals inflammation cause mutations cells’ DNA cells divide mutations repeated produce prostate cancer types mutations occur within man’s body exposure stimulus inherited genetic defects indeed inherited man’s parents mutations called germline defects Two common germline defects found BRCA1 BRCA2 genes whose job repair damage cells’ DNA BRCA genes defective DNA damage inside cells accumulate form tumors men aggressive prostate cancers defective BRCA genes commonly BRCA2 BRCA genes alone though—recent research found 16 DNArepair genes may implicated prostate cancer cancerrelated germline defects include mutations ATM gene regulates cell growth HOXB13 gene involved prostate development CHEK2 gene blunts effect testosterone growth cancer cells inherited genetic mutation likely present men strong family history either prostate cancer breast cancer females males man two firstdegree male relatives father brothers developed prostate cancer five 10 times greater risk man affected firstdegree relatives factors age race diet obesity exercise doubt contribute man’s overall risk profile genetic defects probably strongest single predictor develop prostate cancer Free Healthbeat Signup Get latest health
