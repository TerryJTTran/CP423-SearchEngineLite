packing limits process determined temperature pressure various chemical parameters Indeed substitution limits scarce metals common silicate minerals low—in many cases hundred substituting atoms every

smelting—that releasing metal elements chemically bonded mineral Smelting processes discussed primary importance consideration suitability ore mineral amount energy needed break chemical bonds release
