archaeological evidence coal burned funeral pyres Bronze Age 3000 4000 years ago Wales Aristotle mentions coal “combustible bodies” Meteorologica pupil Theophrastus also records use Romans Britain burned coal 400ce cinders found among ruins Roman villas towns along Roman wall especially Northumberland near outcrop coal seams Hopi Indians southwestern United States mined coal picking scraping

surface fully exposed outcroppings later Middle Ages however exhaustion outcrop coal many places forced change surface underground shaft mining Early shaft mines little wells widened much miners dared face danger collapse Shafts sunk high ground adits—nearhorizontal tunnels—for drainage driven side hill England shallow mine shafts exhausted early 14th century making necessary go deeper expand mining shaft bottoms remained small operations record 1684 shows 70 mines near Bristol employing 123 workers Greater depth created many problems First water could longer simply drained away Crude methods devised lift surface bucketandchain device first powered men later horses continuous belt circular plates drawn pipe Windmills used pumps shafts restricted depths 90 105 metres 300 350 feet

Manpower operating windlass replaced horsepower shafts went deeper horses added Whitehaven 1801 coal hoisted 180 metres four horses rate 42–44 metric tons 46–48 tons nine hours introduction steam

conventional mining techniques described made cyclic operations cutting drilling blasting loading developed association roomandpillar mining oldest basic underground methods roomandpillar mining grew naturally need recover coal mining operations became deeper expensive late 1940s conventional techniques began replaced single machines known continuous miners broke coal seam transferred back haulage system Joy Ripper 1948 first continuous miner applicable roomandpillar method Origins longwall mining principal method modern mining longwall mining introduced early 17th century found general use 19th century long less productive roomandpillar mining began change 1940s continuous system involving “plow” developed Wilhelm Loebbe Germany Pulled across face coal guided pipe face side segmented conveyor plow carved gash bottom seam conveyor snaked face behind advancing plow catch coal chipped gash Substantially reducing labour required coal face except needed install roof support Loebbe system quickly became popular Germany France Low Countries plow limited application British mines poweradvanced segmented conveyor became fundamental part equipment 1952 simple continuous machine called shearer introduced Pulled along face astride conveyor shearer bore series disks fitted picks perimeters mounted shaft perpendicular face revolving disks cut slice coal face machine pulled along plow behind machine cleaned coal dropped face conveyor Roof support technique supporting roof rock bolting became common late 1940s much provide unobstructed working area roomandpillar mining laborious slow operation prevented longwall mining realizing potential late 1950s however powered selfadvancing roof supports introduced British Individually groups supports attached conveyor could

surface similar methods Sledges pulled first men later animals including mules horses oxen even dogs goats Steam locomotives designed Richard Trevithick used fields South Wales Tyne later Pennsylvania

coal preparation begins 19th century adaptation mineralprocessing methods used enriching metallic ores associated impurities early years larger pieces coal simply handpicked pieces composed predominantly mineral matter Washing mechanical devices separate coal associated rocks basis density differences began 1840s first coal preparation necessitated demand higher heating values another
