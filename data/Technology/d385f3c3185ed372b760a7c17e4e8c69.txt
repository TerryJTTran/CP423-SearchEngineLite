shaped custom rather logic petroleum industry usually thought separate chemical industry early days petroleum industry 19th century crude oil merely subjected simple distillation treatment Modern petroleum industrial processes however bring chemical changes products modern refinery complex chemicals definition term petrochemical used describe chemical operations often carried plant primary distillation distinction petroleum industry chemical industry difficult maintain Metals sense chemicals produced chemical means ores sometimes requiring chemical methods dressing refining refining process also involves chemical reactions metals steel lead copper zinc produced reasonably pure form later fabricated useful shapes Yet steel industry example considered part chemical industry modern metallurgy metals titanium tantalum tungsten produced processes involving great chemical skill yet still classified primary metals boundaries chemical industry somewhat confused main raw materials
