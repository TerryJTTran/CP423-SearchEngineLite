raise 100 million refine design plants“If want remove carbon dioxide atmosphere one effective ways removing oceans” Gaurav Sant UCLA professor director Institute Carbon Management “Equatic don’t want call moonshot ICM’s businesses thats one thats going profound impact planet humanity theyre successful” said Robert Feller member ICM’s advisory board principal RDF Advisors provides investment services family office serves general partner private funds Increased use wind solar forms carbonfree energy shifting electric vehicles essential slow rate carbon emissions need largescale removal vast amounts CO2 air oceans already warming planet may even vital International Panel Climate Change made much clear March report underscoring likelihood environmental catastrophe carbon dioxide emissions scaled back dramatically Despite stated goals world’s biggest economies companies global CO2 kept rising 2022 09 record 368 gigatons—an unfathomable 368 trillion kilograms—spewed cars trucks power plants agriculture manufacturing landfill emissions sources according International Energy Agency IPCC estimates midcentury necessary remove 3 12 gigatons CO2 air annually limit global warming 15° Celsius preindustrial levels Equatics technology appears like could contribute goal create fully virtuous cycle ocean CO2 removal hydrogen production questions remain large amount energy process requires there’s risk harming sea life processs byproduct slurry carbonates resembling seashell material “We need find balance necessary address climate circumstance surrounds us time responsible harm” Sant said “What Equatic delivers climate strategy could work scale” Creating MultibillionDollar Business mission “retire carbon Western societies blowing atmosphere last 100 years” Lorenzo Corsini Equatic’s principal advisor told Forbes could lucrative business company wants generate tens millions dollars revenue within years selling carbon offset credits corporate buyers US European Union Japan governments set ever stricter rules carbon emissions business could generate billions dollars annually future Elon Musk’s Tesla learned long ago lucrative credit sales booked 18 billion marginfree revenue automakers need CO2 airpollution credits 2022 “What’s going catalyze business large corporations who’ve pledged become carbon negative buying carbon credits” said Corsini head drug developer BioNTech’s Austrian operations Corsini points foresees regulations coming prevent companies emitting CO2 without paying “It’s going bit like municipal waste cant throw trash street woods need pay it”An illustration Equatics next project larger precommercial carbon direct removal hydrogen generation plant Equatic Hydrogen also core element business especially company generate 1 kilogram That’s cheaper target PlugPower leader race commercialize “green” hydrogen made water renewable power wants get 150kgCO2 “going bit like municipal waste cant throw trash street woods need pay it” Lorenzo Corsini Equatic’s principal advisor Making elemental fuel sources natural gas got particularly attractive last year new 3kilogram federal incentive included Inflation Reduction Act zerocarbon hydrogen may go power vehicles much replace tens millions metric tons fuel made natural gas — process emits carbon — needed industries including steel fuel chemical food production Equatic isn’t startup coming UCLA’s ICM launched 2018 develop decarbonizing technologies potential combat climate change commercially CarbonBuilt instance uses proprietary technology developed Sant’s team turn CO2 industrial sources concrete building blocks materials startups way “Its pretty unique academic center focused carbon management also focused rapidly commercializing lab pilot commercial industrial scale” said Caitlyn Fox vice president strategic initiatives Chan Zuckerberg Initiative philanthropy created Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg wife Priscilla Chan Last year CZI pledged 21 million aid efforts Sant ICM Equatic’s Approach Oceans planet’s main CO2 sink absorbing billions tons air ability keep risk human activities generate gas CO2 levels keep rising oceans keep absorbing they’re becoming acidic — something Equatic’s process could help combat “Think carbon dioxide acid neutralize acid Treat base” Sant said “What essentially allowing really simple acidbase chemistry work advantage way produce material seashells chalk made calcium carbonate”Equatics test barge Port Los Angeles Alan Ohnsman via Forbes approach sketched paper Sant UCLA scientists published 2021 call “singlestep carbon sequestration storage” envisions future plants would large electrochemical reactors lots tanks plumbing piping suck millions gallons seawater pass electrically charged mesh increase pH induces series chemical reactions including combining dissolved carbon dioxide water CO2 air calcium magnesium two elements trap CO2 becoming calcium magnesium carbonates—materials found chalk seashells Hydrogen simultaneously produced byproduct “Its surprising nobody came before” said Corsini “Its high school chemistry far away super difficult”Its high school chemistry far away super difficult” Lorenzo Corsini Equatic’s principal advisor cycling process seawater flows back ocean — carbonate slurry creates Sant believes harmless ocean life since amount material sent back fraction volume water pulled consists elements naturally found seawater Still environmental testing needs done confirm said reducing amount CO2 seawater process frees capacity oceans absorb air ultimately reducing removing atmospheric CO2 — Sant put increase “the CO2 storage capacity seawater” “Go chemistry underlies end process 46 kilograms CO2 removal per cubic meter seawater processed” Sant native India’s Goa state son grandson civil engineers told Forbes Managing Energy Needs it’s energyintense process Removing ton CO2 way requires 2 megawatthours electricity Sant said However simultaneous production energyrich hydrogen helps offset cutting net power requirement 1 megawatthour per ton Still that’s enough energy power 750 homes Though it’s substantial amount Sant believes uses less competing forms CO2 elimination direct air capture “Their needs several times larger ours” said declining elaborate Ideally future Equatic plants would located coastal regions access abundant renewable energy wind solar installations process generates hydrogen would still “carbon negative” even power natural gasfired plants used science behind process verified lab comes tricky part done ever larger pilot facilities ultimately highefficiency commercial plants Singapore play essential role figuring outUCLAs Gaurav Sant center explains approach CO2 removal ocean developed Institute Carbon Management April 12 Port Los AngelesAlan Ohnsman via Forbes “Proving quite critical” said Gurdev Singh environmental engineer senior deputy director technology PUB Singapore’s National Agency He’s working closely Sant team first test something approaching commercial scale things move lab realworld deployment many details need worked including reducing system’s total energy requirements verifying slurry creates truly benign sent back ocean “While synergies benefits one key issues realized early require quite fair bit energy put system although it’s net carbon negative” Singh said“While synergies benefits one key issues realized early require quite fair bit energy put system” Gurdev Singh Sinapore National Water Agency Integrating Equatic’s technology desalination plant obvious choice since latter already pulling vast amounts water though facilities use substantial amounts power harm aquatic life byproduct brine produce dispersed safely there’s additional benefit combining two systems Singh told Forbes Equatic’s removal calcium magnesium seawater “softening” effect “A softened water stream benefits downstream” said Namely lowers overall amount energy needed desalination process reduces scaling typically builds membranes separate water brine Right Singh says use chemicals remove scaling hopeful Equatic’s system cut Even calcium magnesium carbonate slurry created Equatic’s CO2 removal process may prove resource useful pump back ocean “Can go concrete example could go construction materials avoid issue slurry go oceans” Singh said could also potentially used protect Singapore’s coastline erosion rising sea levels “These things need study … additional synergies” Managing system’s energy needs impact ocean aren’t challenges Designing cheaper efficient durable electrodes required start CO2 removal process one biggest addition scaling design small pilots large commercial facilities Still ICM team appears progressing relatively fast according Doug Wicks program director Energy Department’s Advanced Research Projects AgencyEnergy poured 1 million Equatic via federal grantA sample calcium magnesium carbonate slurry thats byproduct Equatics CO2 removal process Alan Ohnsman via Forbes “When funded last year scale reactive cell smaller phone September next visit prototype scale that’s equivalent one deployed” Port Los Angeles Wicks said “They system works simple followup process still great technical challenges funding DOE side really focusing electrodes” “They serious breakthrough Im going minimize got technical challenges approach interesting” Wicks said Pulling CO2 Directly Air Equatic pursuing different tactic spate companies working perfect ways removing CO2 atmosphere via “direct air capture” storing sequestering gas permanently Zurichbased Climeworks early leader direct air capture raised 810 million funding began operating world’s first largest facility Iceland 2021 Many companies including GE Occidental Petroleum Los Angelesbased startup CarbonCapture readying direct air capture sequestration projects go operation next years big challenge method however ensuring CO2 pulled air stays underground storage without leaking Methods pipe transport large amounts captured carbon also need developed unlike Equatic’s seabased approach doesn’t make hydrogen byproduct“Im cleareyed risks Gaurav trust” Robert Feller ICM advisor Similarly Climeworks’ business model based selling carbon credits companies including Microsoft Swiss UBS Shopify Stripe Zendesk company said email intends reach “megaton capacity” carbon removal 2030 “gigaton capacity” 2050 scales company estimates eventually lower cost CO2 capture sequestration 200ton comparison US Energy Department set target 100metric ton companies participating Carbon Shot Negative initiative That’s also cost Sant believes Equatic hit begins commercial operations late decade Equatic’s Corsini thinks company’s approach two key advantages direct air capture eliminates need figure store captured carbon produces highvalue hydrogen “This method locks away capturing one step Thats elegance it” said Sant’s science Equatic’s backers company poised shake carbon capture industry stakes couldn’t higher “The worlds going getting hydrocarbons fossil fuels certainly within lifetime going reliant technological innovation help us get netzero goals—assuming theyre even realistic” ICM advisor Feller said “Im cleareyed risks Gaurav trust” FORBESMORE FORBESClimate Capitalist Billionaire Heiress Betting Big Renewable EnergyBy Jemima McEvoyMORE
