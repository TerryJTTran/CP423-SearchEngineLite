handheld form factor already impressed paper thanks strong specs actually using one person fully sold good hour tinkering I’m already ready toss Steam Deck side forever never look back Related Videos first pass Asus ROG Ally fixes almost every single problem Steam Deck comfortable design vastly improved screen it’s first device kind doesn’t feel like firstpass experiment could true start handheld PC era long price right Related Microsoft please don’t screw Asus ROG Ally I’m blast Hot Wheels Rift Rally cat Zelda Tears Kingdom doubles breakable weapons — I’m thrilled portable portable first picked Asus ROG Ally breathed immediate sigh relief That’s feels significantly better Steam Deck hands system thinner lighter Valve’s offering putting happy middle ground Steam Deck Nintendo Switch It’s comfortable either well much traditional button layout feels naturally inline modern Xbox controller nitpicks back button Dpad placement it’s notable improvement otherwise area Steam Deck advantage button quality ROG Ally feels bit like thirdparty controller spots rather something premium wasn’t impressed flat face buttons find perfectly level triggers bumpers little awkward I’m mostly left questions part durability whether they’ll easy replace much would cost long term That’s one battles ROG Ally doesn’t immediately come top seems winning war every front That’s feels like Asus put lot work making sure still feels like portable device reduced size helps factors play part hard fully hear difference bustling showroom Ally seems quieter system overall Even better able quickly toggle silent setting quick menu tap cutting virtually excess noise though caused Forza Horizon 4’s frame rate plummet 60 30 instantly might expect Despite flashier white design feel like I’d far less selfconscious breaking ROG Ally airplane subway train It’s little discreet overall without sacrificing power Customization potential level customization another area high system first glance Ally uses custom version Armoury Crate tool found Asus’ laptops Pressing dedicated button device brings fast popout menu lets users manage performance settings quick taps Midgame could easily pop open adjust frame rate cap resolution refresh rate settings fast taps menu entirely customized letting add boxes enable video recording airplane mode performance overlay etc someone doesn’t love drilling

joysticks fortunately loud lights turned entirely setting brightness 0 first glance doesn’t seem like get quite granular settings Steam Deck — there’s slider frame rate limit locking common intervals like 30 60 120 — there’s still fair amount control catches eye control customization potential Every button Ally remapped controller mouse keyboard numpad functions — mixed matched together button mapped secondary command allowing turn right trigger shift key press holding back button Better yet buttons mapped complex keyboard commands want make pressing back button brings system’s task manager minimizes window calls onscreen keyboard makes browser navigation feel like much less daunting prospect currently Steam Deck also helps ROG Ally runs familiar version Windows 11 that’s easy use system’s touchscreen someone struggles Linux that’s another win Asus’ corner though preferences may vary I’m fan Valve’s clean SteamOS it’s much loss ROG Ally considering Steam launches big picture mode Ally functions downside less organized software screen doesn’t seem like customized much though appreciate sorted app game launching Xbox Origin Steam etc Unquestionable specs perks nice imagine real selling point people comes performance power angle ROG Ally clearcut advantage Steam Deck starkest difference 120Hz 1920 x 1080 display major improvement Valve’s 60Hz 1200 x 800 screen difference apparent even took Steam Deck compare two colors games like Minecraft Legends Moving looked clear vibrant avoiding washedout look tend get Steam Deck Also nice Armoury Crate includes suite color temperature profiles take advantage screen’s flexibility It’s quite par Nintendo Switch OLED doesn’t feel like compromise either I’d need spend little time system get full sense performance advantage I’m already impressed already knew Ally would step considering runs Zen 4 processor Steam Deck Zen 2 custom AMD chip seems capable running current games like High Life relative stability I’d really get put test Forza Horizon 4 flipping system settings Turbo suddenly hitting 120 framespersecond fps mark Ally didn’t seem break sweat perhaps thanks dual cooling fans Granted that’s last generation’s Forza game it’s still impressive feat handheld compact extra power make longerlasting system Steam Deck Perhaps much feels one year ahead might enough incentive already Steam Deck change loyalties However get little depending prepared buy Asus ecosystem Ally compatible XG Mobile ROG’s external GPU contains RTX 4090 letting players easily dock PC get power boost demo station event attended showed Dying Light 2 Stay Human running device performing flawlessly PC What’s important though could resolve current software headache Steam Deck’s frustrating quirk unpredictable game compatibility Due Steam’s Proton layer I’m always sure game download actually run system unless it’s explicitly verified I’ve multiple scenarios past year I’d launch game discover cutscenes wouldn’t play worse couldn’t boot Ally running Windows 11 already feels like much less hackedtogether device Every game booted worked fussing I’ll need see holds wider selection titles alone could enough make upgrade — especially improved power adding extra reliability modern games question mark battery life though Ally seem par Steam Deck Asus estimates Ally’s battery supports eight hours playtime matching Steam Deck’s top end Naturally estimate greatly vary based dial specs maxing Forza Horizon 4 seemed like track battery run within hour That’s nothing sneeze though considering lot highend games tap around Steam Deck much lower performance prognosis good overall long you’re willing turn settings playing go Walking away handson session real soul searching I’ve grown love Steam Deck past year can’t imagine scenario I’d want use ROG Ally based I’ve seen far Ally better screen improved performance portable design deep customization options less fussy Windows OS Ultimately decision come price
