papermaking processHistorical developmentPapermaking traced ad 105 Ts’ai Lun official attached Imperial court China created sheet paper using mulberry bast fibres along fishnets old rags hemp waste slow travel westward art papermaking reached Samarkand Central Asia 751 793 first paper made Baghdad time Hārūn arRashīd golden age Islāmic culture brought papermaking frontiers EuropeBy 14th century number paper mills existed Europe particularly Spain Italy France Germany invention printing 1450s brought vastly increased demand paper 18th century papermaking process remained essentially unchanged linen cotton rags furnishing basic raw materials Paper mills increasingly plagued shortages 18th century even advertised solicited publicly rags evident process utilizing abundant material neededImprovements materials processesIn 1800 book published launched development practical methods manufacturing paper wood pulp vegetable pulps Several major pulping processes gradually developed relieved paper industry dependency upon cotton linen rags made modern largescale production possible developments followed two distinct pathways one fibres fibre fragments separated wood structure mechanical means wood exposed chemical solutions dissolved removed lignin wood components leaving cellulose fibre behind Made mechanical methods groundwood pulp contains components wood thus suitable papers high whiteness permanence required Chemical wood pulps soda sulfite pulp described used high brightness strength permanence required Groundwood pulp first made Germany 1840 process come extensive use 1870 Soda pulp first manufactured wood 1852 England 1867 patent issued United States sulfite pulping processA sheet paper composed cellulosic fibres “waterleaf” water absorbent Hence
