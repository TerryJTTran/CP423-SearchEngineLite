responsive quick time far resolution goes smartphone runs 2400 x 1080p sports 405ppi pixels per inch giving images crisp overall look bezel noticeably thick toward bottom end phone never found much issue Screen bezel size one tradeoffs come using budgetfriendly devices don’t think Moto G Power 5G’s bezel egregious since never got way function overall feel screen bezel thin sides phone doesn’t feel like impedes much display far screen goes there’s much complain fact it’s OLED 65inch display refresh rate 120Hz phone modestly priced makes something steal — long you’re willing put washedout blacks LCD screen Moto G Power 5G software performance Peter Hunt SzpytekDigital Trends Moto G Power 5G runs Android 13 using MediaTek Dimensity 930 processor comes performance certainly case getting

takes excellent frontfacing photos would stay away builtin portrait mode phone offers tends bump contrast subject creating harsh lines result subpar photo didn’t find much need portrait mode however given solid selfie camera without macro lens offers solid hyperdetailed photos never found using much use case taking photos extremely small items seems opinion pretty slim would preferred telephoto lens better longdistance photography choice Moto G Power 5G another modern smartphone taking picture G Power won’t able hold much candle something like Galaxy S23 iPhone 14 still takes great pictures cameras aren’t available — phones aren’t within budget Moto G Power 5G battery charging Peter Hunt SzpytekDigital Trends Moto G Power 5G sports 5000mAh battery keeps going throughout day without
