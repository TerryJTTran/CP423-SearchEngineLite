available small quantities natural seepage subsurface oil various areas throughout world However limited availability restricted uses petroleum medicinal specialty purposes discovery “rock oil” northwestern Pennsylvania crude oil became available sufficient quantity inspire development largerscale processing systems earliest refineries employed simple distillation units “stills” separate various constituents petroleum heating crude oil mixture vessel condensing resultant vapours liquid fractions Initially primary product kerosene proved abundant cleanerburning lamp oil consistent quality whale oil animal fat lowestboiling raw product still “straight run” naphtha forerunner unfinished gasoline petrol initial commercial application primarily solvent Higherboiling materials found effective lubricants fuel oils largely novelties first perfection oildrilling techniques quickly spread Russia 1890 refineries producing large quantities kerosene fuel oils development internalcombustion engine later years 19th century created small market crude naphtha development automobile turn century sharply increased demand quality gasoline finally provided home petroleum fractions volatile included kerosene demand automotive fuel rose methods continuous distillation crude oil developed Conversion light fuels 1910 demand automotive fuel began outstrip market requirements kerosene refiners pressed develop new technologies increase gasoline yields earliest process called thermal cracking consisted heating heavier oils low market requirement pressurized reactors thereby cracking splitting large molecules smaller ones form lighter valuable fractions gasoline kerosene light industrial fuels Gasoline manufactured cracking process performed better automobile engines gasoline derived straight distillation crude petroleum development powerful airplane engines late 1930s gave rise need increase combustion characteristics gasoline spurred development leadbased fuel additives improve engine performance 1930s World War II sophisticated refining processes involving use catalysts led improvements quality transportation fuels increased supply improved processes—including catalytic cracking heavy oils alkylation polymerization isomerization—enabled petroleum industry meet demands highperformance combat aircraft war supply increasing

increase demand petroleum products also heightened need process wider variety crude oils highquality products Catalytic reforming naphtha replaced earlier thermal reforming process became leading

either gasoline jet fuels Environmental concerns 1970 petroleumrefining industry become well established throughout world Delivery crude oil refined petroleum products reached almost 23 billion tons per year 40 million barrels per day major concentrations refineries developed countries world became aware impact industrial pollution environment however petroleumrefining industry primary focus change Refiners added hydrotreating units extract sulfur compounds products began generate large quantities elemental sulfur Effluent water atmospheric emission hydrocarbons combustion products also became focus increased technical attention addition many refined products came scrutiny Beginning mid1970s petroleum refiners United States around world required develop techniques manufacturing highquality gasoline without employing lead additives beginning 1990s required take substantial investments complete reformulation transportation fuels order minimize environmental emissions industry one time produced single product kerosene disposed unwanted byproduct materials manner possible petroleum refining become one world’s stringently regulated manufacturing industries expending major
