grass family Poaceae cultivated primarily starchy dry fruits Wheat rice corn maize rye oats barley sorghum millets common cerealsThe cultivation cereals varies widely different countries depends partly upon degree economic development factors include nature soil amount rainfall techniques applied promote growth illustrating production problems article uses wheat example information cultivation cereal crops see articles individual crops information food value processing cereals see cereal processing Cultivation wheat wheat fieldWheat cultivated wide range soils successfully grown large portions world ranging altitude sea level 3050 metres 10000 feet Annual rainfall 254 mm 10 inches generally considered minimum soil sufficiently fertile Barley rye grown soil less fertile required wheat Soils good humus content partially decayed organic matter chemical fertilizers generally necessary Purity seed important seed wheat cereal seeds must true particular variety free possible foreign seeds Seeds frequently cleaned avoid contamination seed crops weeds often also treated fungicides prevent disease transmission Modern cleaning methods employ devices oscillating sieves revolving cylinders Seed obtained combine harvester often unsuited use seed wheat without preliminary treatment Spring winter varieties exist wheat barley Winter varieties generally produce better crops morestringent climate requirements Winter wheat form good root system begin form new shoots cold weather sets winter wheat likely tillers side axillary shoots spring wheat rate sowing varies 225 kg per hectare 20 pounds per acre upward Depth sowing usually 25 75 cm 1 3 inches less certain areas Breeding Wheat cereals selffertilized pollen carried stamen given flower impregnates pistil stigma ovary flower enabling variety breed true Wheat flowers grouped spikelets bearing two nine flowers florets produce new varieties crossfertilization cereal breeder artificially transfers stamen one variety flower another selffertilization takes place production sufficient supply new type seeds sowing timeconsuming expensive allows new varieties evolved retaining desirable characteristics parent example United Kingdom Australia varieties wheat yield well often produce flour poor baking quality proper selection parent plants permits new varieties produced yield well still possess good baking qualities Get Britannica Premium subscription gain access exclusive content Subscribe reasons developing new varieties include resistance rust fungus see Fungus diseases diseases resistance drought development stronger shorter straw make harvesting easier Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug developed shortstemmed “dwarf” strain wheat dramatically increased crop yields estimated introduction strain lessdeveloped countries saved many one billion people starvation death Seedbed preparation Various types plowing machinery implements employed render soil suitable planting equipment used depends upon factors climate nature ground rainfall Tillage process preparing soil cultivation purposes varies considerably around world Mechanized plows common commercial cereal farms animaldrawn plows even handtillage techniques often employed small farms especially lessdeveloped countries Serious soil erosion may require special procedures maintain clods plant residues soil North America normal practice grow wheat ground long sufficiently clean crops produced eventually ground must rest fallow year moisture land time sowing important factor ancient procedure rotating cereals legumes improve soil still common Europe though less North America Fertilization ground useful increase crop yield generally increase protein content crop
