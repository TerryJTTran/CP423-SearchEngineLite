linings drive belts chemical compounds manmade fibres produced known polymers class compounds characterized long chainlike molecules great size molecular weight Many polymers constitute manmade fibres similar compounds make plastics rubbers adhesives surface coatings Indeed polymers regenerated cellulose polycaprolactam polyethylene terephthalate become familiar household materials trade names rayon nylon Dacron trademark respectively also made numerous nonfibre products ranging cellophane envelope windows clear plastic softdrink bottles fibres materials prized strength toughness resistance heat mildew ability hold pressed formManmade fibres distinguished natural fibres silk cotton wool Natural fibres also consist polymers case biologically produced compounds cellulose protein emerge textile manufacturing process relatively unaltered state manmade fibres derived naturally occurring polymers instance rayon acetate two first manmade fibres ever produced made cellulose polymers make cotton hemp flax structural fibres wood case rayon acetate however cellulose acquired radically altered state usually woodpulp operations modified order regenerated practical cellulosebased fibres Rayon acetate therefore belong group manmade fibres known regenerated fibresAnother group manmade fibres far larger group synthetic fibres Synthetic fibres made polymers occur naturally instead produced entirely chemical plant laboratory almost always byproducts petroleum natural gas polymers include nylon polyethylene terephthalate mentioned also include many compounds acrylics
