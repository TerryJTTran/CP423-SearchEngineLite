types 1 detonating high explosives 2 deflagrating low explosives Detonating explosives TNT dynamite characterized extremely rapid decomposition development high pressure whereas deflagrating explosives black smokeless powders involve merely fast burning produce relatively low pressures certain conditions use large quantities high degree confinement normally deflagrating explosives caused detonate Detonating explosives usually subdivided two categories primary secondary Primary explosives detonate ignition source flame spark impact means produce heat sufficient magnitude Secondary explosives require detonator cases supplementary booster explosives primary secondary depending conditions use Black powder History black powder may never known certainty invented first explosive black powder mixture saltpetre potassium nitrate sulfur charcoal carbon consensus originated China 10th century use almost exclusively fireworks signals possible Chinese also used black powder bombs military purposes written record mid13th century put bamboo tubes propel stone projectiles however evidence Arabs invented black powder 1300 certainly developed first real gun bamboo tube reinforced iron used charge black powder fire arrow strong case also made black powder discovered English medieval scholar Roger Bacon wrote explicit instructions preparation 1242 strange form Latin anagram

suitable boring implements fear roof collapse use black powder mining spread rapidly though widely accepted 1700 first application civil engineering Malpas Tunnel Canal du Midi France 1679 300 years unvarying composition black powder approximately 75 percent saltpetre potassium nitrate 15 percent charcoal 10 percent sulfur saltpetre originally extracted compost piles animal wastes Deposits found India provided source many years 1850s tremendous quantities sodium nitrate discovered Chile saltpetre formed reaction potassium chloride plentiful supply Chilean nitrate first considered satisfactory manufacture black powder readily absorbed moisture Lammot du Pont American industrialist solved problem started making sodium nitrate powder 1858 became popular short time although produce high quality explosive potassium nitrate suitable mining construction applications much less expensive distinguish potassium nitrate sodium nitrate versions came known B blasting powder respectively powder continued use special purposes required higher quality principally firearms military devices safety fuses
