inundating cultural homelands native peoples forced relocate reservoir “take” areas created largescale dams None concerns sprang without warning roots date back many decades environmental problems associated dams exacerbated dams increased height However even relatively small dams prompted opposition people believe interests adversely affected particular structure example colonial America legal
