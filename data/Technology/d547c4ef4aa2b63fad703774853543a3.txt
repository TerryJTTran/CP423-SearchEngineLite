Several different fractions particles density hence similar composition produced valuable mineral components determined chemical analysis microscopic analysis polished sections Size analysis Coarsely ground minerals classified according size running special sieves screens various national international standards accepted One old standard obsolete Tyler Series wire screens identified mesh size

optical measurement methods employ light laser beams various frequencies Comminution order separate valuable components ore waste rock minerals must liberated interlocked state physically comminution rule comminution begins crushing ore certain size finishes grinding powder ultimate fineness depends fineness dissemination desired mineral primitive times crushers small handoperated pestles mortars grinding done millstones turned men horses waterpower Today processes carried mechanized crushers mills Whereas crushing done mostly dry conditions grinding mills operated dry wet wet grinding predominant Crushing ores occur nature mixtures discrete mineral particles gold gravel beds streams diamonds mines mixtures require little crushing since valuables recoverable using techniques breaking placer material log washers instance ores however made hard tough rock masses must crushed valuable minerals released order produce crushed material suitable use mill feed 100 percent pieces must less 10 14 millimetres 04 06 inch diameter crushing done stages primary stage devices used mostly jaw crushers openings wide two metres crush ore less 150 millimetres suitable size serve feed secondary crushing stage stage ore crushed cone crushers less 10 15 millimetres material feed grinding mill Grinding process stage crushed material disintegrated cylinder mill cylindrical container built varying lengthtodiameter ratios mounted axis substantially horizontal partially filled grinding bodies eg flint stones iron steel balls caused tumble influence gravity revolving container special development autogenous semiautogenous mill Autogenous mills operate without grinding bodies instead coarser part ore simply grinds smaller fractions semiautogenous mills become widespread 5 10 percent grinding bodies usually metal spheres added Crushinggrinding Yet another development combining processes crushing grinding roll crusher consists essentially two cylinders mounted horizontal shafts driven opposite directions cylinders pressed together high pressure comminution takes place material bed
