Founders Fund Radiant Industries says megawatt nuclear power generators cleaner safer compared diesel alternatives dominate market remote backup power generation Thanks wildfires hurricanes natural disasters past years seen uptick use diesel generators backup power grid goes California alone number generators shot 34 2018 2020 according policy analyst firm MCubed power vital emergency situations operate medical needed equipment comes huge cost human health “If operate one megawatt diesel generator committing statistically increased cancer rates” says Doug Bernauer CEO Radiant Industries He’s wrong 2012 International Agency Research Cancer arm World Health Organization concluded diesel exhaust definitely causes cancer based decades research study risks get compounded around world diesel generators aren’t used emergencies everyday power supply According International Finance Organization regions Africa “backup” diesel generators responsible 40 daily power generation That’s Bernauer’s company comes goal build portable nuclear generators capable producing megawatt power potentially enough power 1000 homes packed shipping container moved around it’s needed without harmful pollution costs associated diesel “I think way people think nuclear changing now” Bernauer 41 says “In past five 10 years theres vision new future nuclear plays role” Monday Radiant announced raised 40 million series B round led Andreessen Horowitz bring future bringing total capital raised 55 million investment geared towards accelerating development company’s nuclear power technology goal getting commercial production 2028 “In recent years wars pandemics ransomware attacks extreme weather events pushed supply chains power grids people brink — creating real inflection point industries haven’t reason change historically” Andreessen Horowitz General Partner David Ulevitch joined Radiant’s Board Directors told Forbes statement “Radiant bringing innovation mentality engineering rigor honed aerospace nuclear another industry dire need renewed ingenuity innovation”Conceptual art 5 Radiant reactors single site Radiant Industries Building Nuclear Power Plant Box heart Radiant’s generators calls Kaleidos nuclear fuel called TRISO particles small particles size poppy seed comprised uranium oxygen carbon covered ceramic carbon materials particles formulated larger cylinders spheres depending reactor design use reactors One major advantage TRISO particles high melting point making reactors based fuel theoretically meltdownproof Tests materials taken particles temperatures 3000 degrees Fahrenheit almost damage give idea hot napalm creates temperatures 2000 degrees That’s well beyond temperatures nuclear reactors ever get comes safety Kaleidos similar microreactor concepts Todd Allen chair nuclear engineering University Michigan tells Forbes risk par reactors dozens college campuses around country used nuclear research “There’s lot less radioactive material systems lot less complex they’re harder fail” says “There’s long list reasons plants lot safer traditional big light water reactor” says “And safety records pretty good” April Novak nuclear engineer Argonne National Laboratory working Radiant development reactors notes several aspects Kaleidos’ design makes unique among microreactor concepts developed First small portable design makes ideal number applications ranging providing backup power emergencies set along highways provide power electric vehicle charging also says company’s aiming towards passive heat removal system using helium coolant significantly reduces chances accident also means even reactor suddenly shut heat dissipation would prevent chance meltdown 2024 company conducting first tests design using electric heaters first make sure works planned real world “All different aspects give Radiant design unique position advanced reactor space” says“I think we’re going see huge shift people realize care environment care nuclear” Founders Fund partner Scott Nolan Rockets Reactors Bernauer didn’t set become nuclear engineer 2007 joined SpaceX avionics engineer company successfully launched first rocket SpaceX Bernauer became part team developed Grasshopper prototype – rocket could launch land whose systems became integrated company’s Falcon 9 rocket routinely launches lands rocket reusedRadiant CEO Doug BernauerRadiant Industries successfully finishing Grasshopper Bernauer says “I started weird Elon side projects” included things like Hyperloop work led Boring Company Another project figuring make fuel Mars company’s Starship rockets could refueled sent back Earth Powering fuel production Bernauer says would take “three football fields” worth solar panels impracticality led look possibilities nuclear power instead solved lot problems raised using solar power purpose 2019 Department Defense issued call industry small portable microreactors size shipping containers could used military Bernauer seemed like great opportunity prove small nuclear reactor concept working potential use Mars military customer would mean stability terms potential revenue regulatory pathways left SpaceX found Radiant year Since company focused developing technology begun working Idaho National Laboratory Argonne National Laboratory federal program enables industry take advantage research expertise developed national laboratories Scott Nolan partner Founders Fund invested Radiant work National Labs key proving potential customers–and general public–that company’s reactors built safely efficiently company proven approved regulators says “I think we’re going see huge shift people realize care environment care nuclear” Radiant’s designs proven engineering testing approved regulators company believes strong market potential Today diesel generator market United States alone 58 billion according analyst IBISWorld Bernauer believes company’s reactors–which refueled every five years so–will attractive remote communities located far electric grid may unreliable supply chain refuel diesel Radiant’s CEO simply focused taking money company raised meet ambitious goal one first novel nuclear reactors approved commercial market since industry’s heyday 1970s also aims change attitudes business sector nuclear industry that’s notorious delayed overbudget projects “In world get reactor designed built time budget everything change” Bernauer says ForbesMORE FORBESInside Audacious Plan Use 10000 Nuclear Microreactors Wean World CoalBy Christopher HelmanMORE FORBESThe NASA Alum Turned
