sells OLED panels companies like Sony Vizio Philips Panasonic you’ll see OLED televisions companies Even though panels essentially identical image processing Sony LG others proprietary you’ll still see differences picture quality one OLED TV another However LG Display recently joined Samsung version OLED technology aforementioned QDOLED It’s quite technology use Samsung calls “selfilluminating LEDs” Samsung uses OLED technology little differently we’ll get moment miniLED read new TV options might see products touting miniLED technology may sound like competitor QLED OLED it’s actually improvement LED backlighting used QLED LED TVs MiniLEDs tiny compared regular LEDs means QLED TV could normally accommodate hundreds LEDs accommodate tens thousands miniLEDs result Way control

earlier miniLED backlights one way QLED TV makers trying improve situation real potential we’re quite ready declare OLED killer OLED comes top OLED pixel isn’t getting electricity doesn’t produce light therefore stays totally black Winner OLED Brightness Samsung’s 98inch QN100B series produce brightness 5000 nits Caleb DenisonDigital Trends QLED TVs considerable advantage comes brightness use separate backlights instead relying pixel create light LED backlights made incredibly achingly bright — bright enough seen clearly even brightly lit rooms OLED panels can’t compete pure brightness basis lightemitting individual pixels simply can’t produce amount light dark room isn’t problem fact we’d argue it’s preferable OLED achieve contrast less brightness making viewing dark room less retinasearing experience That’s addition much easier power bill welllit environments lots daylight streams windows QLED TVs visible — especially you’re playing HDR content conditions OLED panels
