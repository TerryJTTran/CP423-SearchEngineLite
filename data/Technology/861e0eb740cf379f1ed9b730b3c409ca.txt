canning pasteurization freezing irradiation addition chemicals Advances packaging materials played important role modern food preservation Spoilage mechanisms expiration datesSee videos articleFood spoilage may defined change renders food unfit human consumption changes may caused various factors including contamination microorganisms infestation insects degradation endogenous enzymes present naturally food addition physical chemical changes tearing plant animal tissues oxidation certain constituents food may promote food spoilage Foods obtained plant animal sources begin spoil soon harvest slaughter enzymes contained cells plant animal tissues may released result mechanical damage inflicted postharvest handling enzymes begin break cellular material chemical reactions catalyzed enzymes result degradation food quality development offflavours deterioration texture loss nutrients typical microorganisms cause food spoilage bacteria eg Lactobacillus yeasts eg Saccharomyces molds eg Rhizopus Microbial contamination Hear colourcoded gellike smart tags change colour food gets spoiledSee videos articleBacteria fungi yeasts molds principal types microorganisms cause food spoilage

intestines plant surfaces sewage food processing machinery utensils Bacteria Bacteria unicellular organisms simple internal structure compared cells organisms increase number bacteria population commonly referred bacterial growth microbiologists growth result division one bacterial cell two identical bacterial cells process called binary fission optimal growth conditions bacterial cell may divide approximately every 20 minutes Thus single cell produce almost 70 billion cells 12 hours factors influence growth bacteria include nutrient availability moisture pH oxygen levels presence absence inhibiting substances eg antibiotics Britannica Quiz Facts Food Processing Quiz nutritional requirements bacteria chemical elements carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus sulfur magnesium potassium sodium calcium iron bacteria obtain elements utilizing gases atmosphere metabolizing certain food constituents carbohydrates proteins Temperature pH play significant role controlling growth rates bacteria Bacteria may classified three groups based temperature requirement optimal growth thermophiles 55–75 °C 130–170 °F mesophiles 20–45 °C 70–115 °F psychrotrophs 10–20 °C 50–70 °F addition bacteria grow best neutral environment pH equal 7 Get Britannica Premium subscription gain access exclusive content Subscribe Bacteria also require certain amount available water growth availability water expressed water activity defined ratio vapour pressure water food vapour pressure pure water specific temperature Therefore water activity food product always value 0 1 0 representing absence water 1 representing pure water bacteria grow foods water activity 091 although halophilic bacteria able tolerate high salt concentrations grow foods water activity lower 075 Growth may controlled lowering water activity—either adding solutes sugar glycerol salt removing water dehydration oxygen requirements optimal growth vary considerably different bacteria bacteria require presence free oxygen growth called obligate aerobes whereas bacteria poisoned presence oxygen called obligate anaerobes Facultative anaerobes bacteria grow presence absence oxygen addition oxygen concentration oxygen reduction potential growth medium influences bacterial growth oxygen reduction potential relative measure oxidizing reducing capacity growth medium bacteria contaminate food substrate takes time start growing lag phase period bacteria adjusting environment Following lag phase log phase population grows logarithmic fashion population grows bacteria consume available nutrients produce waste products nutrient supply depleted growth rate enters stationary phase number viable bacteria cells remains stationary phase rate bacterial cell growth equal rate bacterial cell death rate cell death becomes greater rate cell growth population enters decline phase bacterial population expressed either per gram per square centimetre surface area Rarely total bacterial population exceed 1010 cells per gram population less 106 cells per gram cause noticeable spoilage except raw milk Populations 106 107 cells per gram cause spoilage foods example generate offodours vacuumpackaged meats Populations 107 108 cells per gram produce offodours meats vegetables levels 5 × 107 cells per gram foods exhibit form spoilage conditions bacterial cell growth unfavourable eg low high temperatures low moisture content several species bacteria produce resistant cells called endospores Endospores highly resistant heat chemicals desiccation drying ultraviolet light endospores may remain dormant long periods time conditions become favourable growth eg thawing meats endospores germinate produce viable cells begin exponential growth
