application machines tasks performed human beings increasingly tasks would otherwise impossible Although term mechanization often used refer simple replacement human labour machines automation generally implies integration machines selfgoverning system Automation revolutionized areas introduced scarcely aspect modern life unaffected itThe term automation coined automobile industry 1946 describe increased use automatic devices controls mechanized production lines origin word attributed DS Harder engineering manager Ford Motor Company time term used widely manufacturing context also applied outside manufacturing connection variety systems significant substitution mechanical electrical computerized action human effort intelligenceIn general usage automation defined technology concerned performing process means programmed commands combined automatic feedback control ensure proper execution instructions resulting system capable operating without human intervention development technology become increasingly dependent use computers computerrelated technologies Consequently automated systems become increasingly sophisticated complex Advanced systems represent level capability performance surpass many ways abilities humans accomplish activitiesAutomation technology matured point number technologies developed achieved recognition status Robotics one technologies specialized branch automation automated machine possesses certain anthropomorphic humanlike characteristics typical humanlike characteristic modern industrial robot powered mechanical arm

represented prehistoric man’s attempts direct physical strength control human intelligence Thousands years undoubtedly required development simple mechanical devices machines wheel lever pulley power human muscle could magnified next extension development powered machines require human strength operate Examples machines include waterwheels windmills simple steamdriven devices 2000 years ago Chinese developed triphammers powered flowing water waterwheels early Greeks experimented simple reaction motors powered steam mechanical clock representing rather complex assembly builtin power source weight developed 1335 Europe Windmills mechanisms automatically turning sails developed Middle Ages Europe Middle East steam engine represented major advance development powered machines marked beginning Industrial Revolution two centuries since introduction Watt steam engine powered engines machines devised obtain energy steam electricity chemical mechanical nuclear sources new development history powered machines brought increased requirement control devices harness power machine earliest steam engines required person open close valves first admit steam piston chamber exhaust Later slide valve mechanism devised automatically accomplish functions need human operator regulate amount steam controlled engine’s speed power requirement human attention operation steam engine eliminated flyingball governor Invented James Watt England device consisted weighted ball hinged arm mechanically coupled output shaft engine rotational speed shaft increased centrifugal force caused weighted ball moved outward motion controlled valve reduced steam fed engine thus slowing engine flyingball governor remains elegant early example negative feedback control system increasing output system used decrease activity system Negative feedback widely used means automatic control achieve constant operating level system common example feedback control system thermostat used modern buildings control room temperature device decrease room temperature causes electrical switch close thus turning heating unit room temperature rises switch opens heat supply turned thermostat set turn heating unit particular set point Another important development history automation Jacquard loom see photograph demonstrated concept programmable machine 1801 French inventor JosephMarie Jacquard devised automatic loom capable producing complex patterns textiles controlling motions many shuttles different coloured threads selection different patterns determined program contained steel cards holes punched cards ancestors paper cards tapes control modern automatic machines concept programming machine developed later 19th century Charles Babbage English mathematician proposed complex mechanical “analytical engine” could perform arithmetic data processing Although Babbage never able complete device precursor modern digital computer See computers
