WiFi headphones first offer lossless hires audio Spotify gets first major redesign 10 years TikToklike scroll Spotify HiFi ever see light day Phil NickinsonDigital Trends There’s good easy argument shouldn’t won’t argument comes money things course Spotify record number monthly active users premium subscribers revenue actually 4 percent quarter 14 percent year year operating loss 156 million euros 172 million It’s pretty safe assume higherquality file cost Spotify serve either licensing standpoint pure streaming standpoint there’s basic math user count Spotify still growing despite Spotify HiFi still MIA competitors like Apple Music Amazon Music lagging far behind Neither companies gives actual numbers data messy industry estimates put somewhere around half much Spotify hand services rounding error parent companies it’s worth noting wasn’t single mention Spotify HiFi Q1 earnings call holding hope however Ek left smidge daylight Answering question new features — specifically new user interface AI DJ — stressed company patient comes new products features Painfully patient really look user’s point view “We’re rolling slowly make sure performance dialed react

antiTwitter It’s going rush something “I’m using moment educate investors analysts well product improvements can’t turn button on” said things we’ve building last 12 even 18 months cases even longer” Another possible indication Spotify HiFi’s nonappearance don’t call delay may patience timing release also could tied pricing Ek reminded everyone Spotify’s price hasn’t gone basically said expect point “I feel really good ability raise prices time — ability” said “And lots data backs … timing’s right raise rates think price increase go well we’re delivering lot value customers” There’s plenty value already course also could see Spotify soften blow price increase simultaneous launch something like Spotify HiFi increase say 4 5 month Spotify Premium could include higherquality audio stream clear Ek didn’t allude Spotify HiFi though vaguely mention “three new verticals behind music podcasts audiobooks” none sounded imminent Ek pushed patience angle even “Again kind hinting things works”
