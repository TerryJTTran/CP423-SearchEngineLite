fan base needed past years season three books let’s look back 24 episodes show far Book Boba Fett included attempt highlight best show offered far Related Videos 24 Chapter 6 Prisoner first episode Mandalorian made wonder show really wasn’t episode Din shows random space station pull prison break Star Wars weirdos almost entirely Groguless episode cheaplooking production overly cartoony characters Worst doesn’t nearly enough fun prison break premise see Andor Even stranger much Din Djarin’s backstory that’s mentioned episode never brought making one feel even place series saving grace Prisoner marks first appearance New Republic XWings side story New Republic quickly grew one favorite side stories series — hopefully much come 23 Chapter 17 Apostate first episode season three Mandalorian felt like table setting episode show far plot lines characters set nearly every following episode season way felt heavyhanded exciting Leading season dud difficult especially confusion annoyance Book Boba Fett played Apostate didn’t much quell concerns future show even fun payoffs later season — BB12 Mandalorian suffers sometimes feeling formulaic especially there’s little way big splashes new canon character introductions first episode season one job get excited rest season Unfortunately that’s opposite Apostate ranks low list 22 Chapter 5 Gunslinger Remember revisiting Tatooine felt bit novel Okay maybe never considering much time spend planet Book Boba Fett little pitstop hasty reintroduction Unlike like deep dive Tatooine’s culture politics provided Phantom Menace Book Boba Fett — Gunslinger’s swing favorite locations original trilogy felt indulgent much liked idea young Han Solowannabe character ended awkward writing stiff acting first season also first time remember thinking limits Volume technology bit apparent especially desert scenes there’s one highlight episode though it’s interesting exploration nomadic Tuskens like nuance episode brought unique Star Wars characters would get explored Book Boba Fett course 21 Chapter 22 Guns Hire ever divisive episode Mandalorian Guns Hire one features Jack Black Lizzo rulers utopian planet uses repurposed Prequelera droids keep little society going It’s bad idea storyline I’m someone minds Star Wars leans sillier bits even liked goodcopbadcop interplay BoKatan Din harkening back ObiWan sleuthing around Kamino Attack Clones lot oneoff disconnected adventures show wish writing gone deeper allowed interesting character moments interesting thematic elements wish show time explore also squeeze big fight BoKatan leader Mandalorian fleet That’s kind pacing tone problem show consistently faced Guns Hire among worst offenders 20 Chapter 4 Sanctuary There’s plenty stuff like episode includes introduction Cara Dune rowdy fistfight slower character moments learn first bits Din’s backstory even battle ATST it’s recontextualized horror monster woods montage training village farmers fight little silly liked opportunity slow enough Din forced consider living another life It’s smallscale characterbased story even ends feeling bit inconsequential grand scheme things hey nothing else episode gave birth Grogu drinking bone broth moment 19 Chapter 19 Convert Mandalorian known taking detours occasionally Convert doesn’t spend time away main characters — also completely takes turn terms pacing tone It’s leisurely slowbuild pace isn’t welldone it’s feels like may shot different show entirely wouldn’t surprised actually cut nowcanceled Rangers New Republic show story Convert though centers two characters Dr Pershing Elia Kane attempting readjust life part New Republic Amnesty Program don’t get wrong Seeing inner workings life New Republic Coruscant interesting right don’t jive way handled may way Mandalorian edited storyline third season show didn’t work featured episode It’s shame tell kind show may building would really liked 18 Chapter 20 Foundling surface episode BoKatan winning trust Din’s covert thanks extended flashback Grogu’s past episode becomes fixated idea Mandalorian foundlings context season didn’t feel like big move forward internet exploded saw Ahmed Best Jar Jar Binks fame portray Kelleran Beq Jedi rescued Grogu aftermath Order 66 touching scene meta level reflection way children orders clans treated Grogu’s official induction Mandalorian clan perfect blend Star Wars absurdity unabashed cuteness Remember series made teddy bearlike creatures deadly Ewoks put tiny green lightsaber puppet’s hand fight idea Grogu someday walking around miniature suit Beskar might headed Foundling starts play idea first time 17 Chapter 18 Mines Mandalore BoKatan takes spotlight highly anticipated episode show sees return Mandalore surprisingly quickly sure wish we’d gotten wideeyed looks history planet especially since everyone intimately familiar lore behind planet supposed feel grand ended feeling like another romp yet another abandoned planet yet juice ending Mines Mandalore felt worth squeeze mystery BoKatan mystical experience seeing mythosaur set years splitsecond sight perfect — left much interest rest season would take story Mandalorians 16 Chapter 14 Tragedy entire second season building appearance Boba Fett didn’t disappoint Placing Grogu seeing stone Tython created great setup clashing factions episode primarily consists came show see man Mandalorian helmet destroy stormtroopers Tragedy might rank higher list I’m certainly along ride desire characterize old man Boba Fett badass gets bit excessive tryhard suppose thank director Robert Rodriguez cliffhanger ending delightfully campy though it’s hard get emotional see little Grogu’s puppet hands binders destruction Razor Crest capture Grogu episode hero’s true allislost moment certainly lives name episode 15 Chapter 24 Return season three finale lot riding — perhaps little much Fans expected massive twist story instead Return straightforward finale could imagined main character deaths except perhaps Gideon traitors major plot points set next season — even postcredit scene let’s focus episode provide exhilarating midair battle Mandalorians scary moments Grogu danger heartwarming adoption scene end story ends resetting stakes new season Grogu Din taking job adventuring around outer rim New Republic It’s hard see could lead season four connect Dave Filoni’s eventual film may many years away Still hoping see Din take helmet Grogu speak first words Gideon’s horde clones something BoKatan ride mythosaur — lot hinted never came fruition 14 Chapter 12 Siege Siege acts reunion familiar faces season one bringing back Carl Weathers Gina Carano adventure Navarro even get unnamed bluefaced Mythrol character first episode Siege feels like classic Mandalorian episode It’s overly memorable features fun action lots cute Grogu moments interesting tieins larger galaxy fans particular Siege gave us first glimpses Dr Pershing’s cloning attempts looked lot like experimenting creatures like Supreme Leader Snoke test tubes story we’re going get eventually love seeing connected universe Star Wars tying things together 13 Chapter 3 Sin episode represents original turning point Din Djarin’s character collected bounty upgraded armor Din decides go back Grogu singlehandedly taking entire crew Imperial baddies first time seeing multiple Mandalorians battle together live action sounds quaint considering comes season three love seeing Werner Herzog’s character episode one many involve Din rescuing Grogu killing lots people along way Mandalorian Liam Neeson Taken Yeah that’s vibe episode totally works 12 Chapter 10 Passenger Star Wars horror episode frog lady doesn’t seem like would work it’s exactly type experiment format Mandalorian allowed creators toy frog lady character fun Star Wars design thrill giant ice spider attack lots fun wish show leaned even harder horror takes first half show get back Tatooine really detour “plot” season one that’s much fun larger story plus — doesn’t love running gag Grogu’s obsession eating frog lady’s eggs enjoyment episode aided introduction Carson Teva quickly becomes one favorite side characters series Seeing XWing pilots function highway patrol perfect — exact kind small details make galaxy feel lived 11 Chapter 9 Marshal There’s lot discussion Star Wars canon community much novels video games animated shows would tie liveaction shows would never thought I’d see deepcut cowboy character Aftermath books Chuck Wendig liveaction — even merely another ladder rung journey Boba Fett seeing mostly ignored Sequel trilogy hopes weren’t high Ahsoka series way though Cobb Vanth’s appearance beginning loved seeing Mandalorian make direct allusions Western genre always part DNA end Timothy Olyphant cosplaying Mandalorian fun — Krayt Dragon certainly didn’t disappoint lot big monsters beasts show end season 3 don’t hit excitement Marshal‘s Krayt Dragon 10 Chapter 11 Heiress canon nerd loves episode reintroduction BoKatan highly anticipated love different viewpoint provided show learn Din isn’t average Mandalorian instead involved sort cult Din’s meeting Bo reframes much happened
