contribution British pharmacologist Sir James Black field led development first drugs selectively block effects epinephrine norepinephrine heart beta blockers betaadrenergic blocking agents second drugs block effect histamine stomach H2blocking agents major therapeutic importance Receptors many hormones neurotransmitters isolated biochemically characterized receptors proteins incorporated cell membrane way binding region faces exterior cell allows endogenous chemicals freer access cell Receptors steroid hormones eg hydrocortisones estrogens differ located cell nucleus therefore accessible molecules enter cell across membrane drug bound receptor certain intermediate processes must take place drug effect measurable Various mechanisms known involved processes receptor activation cellular response also called receptoreffector coupling Among important ones following 1 direct control ion channels cell membrane 2 regulation cellular activity way intracellular chemical signals cyclic adenosine 3′5′monophosphate cAMP inositol phosphates calcium ions 3 regulation gene expression first type mechanism ion channel part protein complex receptor biochemical intermediates involved Receptor activation briefly opens transmembrane ion channel resulting flow ions across membrane causes change transmembrane potential cell leads initiation inhibition electrical impulses mechanisms common neurotransmitters act rapidly Examples include receptors acetylcholine fast excitatory inhibitory transmitter substances nervous system glutamate gammaaminobutyric acid GABA epinephrinestimulated cAMP synthesisIn second mechanism chemical reactions take place within cell trigger series responses receptor may control calcium influx outer cell membrane thereby altering concentration free calcium ions within cell may control catalytic activity one membranebound enzymes One enzymes adenylate cyclase catalyzes conversion adenosine triphosphate ATP within cell cAMP turn binds activates intracellular enzymes catalyze attachment phosphate groups functional proteins may involved wide variety intracellular processes muscle contraction cell division membrane permeability ions second receptorcontrolled enzyme phosphodiesterase catalyzes cleavage membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol releasing intracellular messenger inositol triphosphate substance turn releases calcium intracellular stores thus raising free calcium ion concentration Regulation concentration free calcium ions important like cAMP calcium ions control many cellular functions information intracellular signaling molecules see second messenger kinase third type mechanism peculiar steroid hormones related drugs steroid binds receptor consists primarily nuclear proteins interaction occurs inside cell agonists receptor must able cross cell membrane drugreceptor complex acts specific regions genetic material deoxyribonucleic acid DNA cell nucleus resulting increased rate synthesis proteins decreased rate others Steroids generally act much slowly hours days agents act either two mechanisms Many receptormediated events show phenomenon desensitization means continued repeated administration drug produces progressively smaller effect Among complex mechanisms involved conversion receptors refractory unresponsive state presence agonist activation cannot occur removal receptors cell membrane downregulation prolonged exposure agonist Desensitization reversible process although take hours days receptors recover downregulation converse process upregulation occurs instances receptor antagonists administered adaptive responses undoubtedly important drugs given period time may account partly phenomenon tolerance increase dose needed produce given effect occurs
