plants Nectar may consist 50 80 percent water bees convert honey contain 16 18 percent water Sometimes collect honeydew exudate certain plantsucking insects store honey primary carbohydrate diet bees honey also collect pollen dustlike male element anthers flowers Pollen provides essential proteins necessary rearing young bees act collecting nectar pollen provision nest bees pollinate flowers visit
