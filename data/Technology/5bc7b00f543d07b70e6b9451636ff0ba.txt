product saipo word soap derived importance soap washing cleaning apparently recognized 2nd century ce Greek physician Galen mentions medicament means cleansing body Previously soap used medicine writings attributed 8thcentury Arab savant Jābir ibn Hayyān Geber repeatedly mention soap cleansing agent Europe soap production Middle Ages centred first Marseille later Genoa Venice Although soap manufacture developed Germany substance little used central Europe box soap presented Duchess Juelich 1549 caused sensation late 1672 German Leo sent Lady von Schleinitz parcel containing soap Italy accompanied detailed description use mysterious product first English soapmakers appeared end 12th century Bristol 13th 14th centuries small community grew neighbourhood Cheapside London days soapmakers pay duty soap produced Napoleonic Wars tax rose high three pence per pound soapboiling pans fitted lids could locked every night tax collector order prevent production cover darkness 1853 high tax finally abolished sacrifice state £1000000 Soap came common use 19th century Justus von Liebig German chemist declared quantity soap consumed nation accurate measure wealth civilization Early soap production Early soapmakers probably used ashes animal fats Simple wood plant ashes containing potassium carbonate dispersed water fat added solution mixture boiled ashes added water evaporated process slow chemical splitting neutral fat took place fatty acids could react alkali carbonates plant ash form soap reaction called saponification French soapboiling plant 1771Animal fats containing percentage free fatty acids used Celts presence free fatty acids certainly helped get process started method probably prevailed end Middle Ages slaked lime came used causticize alkali carbonate process chemically neutral fats could saponified easily caustic lye production soap handicraft industry helped introduction Leblanc process production soda ash brine 1790 work French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul 1823 showed process saponification chemical process splitting fat alkali salt fatty acids soap glycerin method producing soap boiling open steam introduced end 19th century another
