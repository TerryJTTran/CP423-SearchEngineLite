agricultural economics study allocation distribution utilization resources used along commodities produced farming Agricultural economics plays role economics development continuous level farm surplus one wellsprings technological commercial growthIn general one say large fraction country’s population depends agriculture livelihood average incomes low mean country poor population engaged agriculture closer truth say country poor people must rely upon agriculture living Agriculture economic development country develops economically relative importance agriculture declines primary reason shown 19thcentury German statistician Ernst Engel discovered incomes increase proportion income spent food declines example family’s income increase 100 percent amount would spend food might increase 60 percent formerly expenditures food 50 percent budget increase would amount 40 percent budget follows incomes increase smaller fraction total resources society required produce amount food demanded population Progress farming fact would surprised economists early 19th century feared limited supply land populated areas Europe would determine continent’s ability feed growing population fear based socalled law diminishing returns given conditions increase amount labour capital applied fixed amount land results lessthanproportional increase output food principle valid one classical economists could foresee extent state arts methods production would change changes occurred agriculture others occurred sectors economy major effect supply food looking back upon history developed countries one see agriculture played important part process enrichment one thing development occur agriculture must able produce surplus food maintain growing nonagricultural labour force Since food essential life services provided merchants bankers factories economy cannot shift activities unless food available barter sale sufficient quantities support engaged Unless food obtained international trade country normally develop industrially farm areas supply towns food exchange products factories Economic development also requires growing labour force agricultural country workers needed must come rural population Thus agriculture must supply surplus food towns must also able produce increased amount food relatively smaller labour force may substituting animal power human power gradually

may converted funds needed purchase industrial equipment build roads provide public services reasons country seeking develop economy may well advised give significant priority agriculture Experience developing countries shown agriculture made much productive proper investment irrigation systems research fertilizers insecticides herbicides Fortunately many advances applied science require massive amounts capital although may necessary expand marketing transportation facilities farm output brought entire population One difficulty giving priority agriculture increase farm output income gains concentrated certain regions rather extending throughout country remaining farmers able produce actually suffer disadvantage farm prices decline easy answer problem developing countries need aware economic progress consistent lingering backwardness seen parts southern Italy Appalachian area United States Peasant agriculture One characteristic undeveloped peasant agriculture selfsufficiency Farm families circumstances consume substantial part produce output may sold market total production generally much larger needed maintenance family productivity per worker low conditions yields per unit land also low Even land originally fertile fertility likely depleted decades continuous cropping available manures sufficient farmers cannot afford purchase elsewhere Peasant agriculture often said characterized inertia peasant farmer likely illiterate suspicious outsiders reluctant try new methods food patterns remain unchanged decades even centuries Evidence however suggests apparent inertia may simply result lack alternatives nothing better change little point changing Moreover selfsufficient farmer bound want minimize risks since crop failure mean starvation many parts world farmers reluctant adopt new methods would expose greater risks failure rice plantingThe increased use worldwide highyielding varieties rice wheat 1960s showed farmers willing able adopt new crops farming methods superiority demonstrated highyielding varieties however required increased outlays fertilizer well expanded facilities storage distribution many developing countries unable afford expenditures labour force economic development proceeds large proportion farm labour force must shift agriculture pursuits fundamental shift labour force made possible course enormous increase output per worker agriculture becomes modernized increase output stems various factors land plentiful output per worker likely higher possible employ fertilizer machinery per worker
