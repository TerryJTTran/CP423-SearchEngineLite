Jacob Roach Digital Trends It’s hard overstate big UltraGear OLED 45 really It’s 445inch monitor 219 aspect ratio footprint multiplied due steep 800R curve Even compared display like Asus ROG PG42UQ UltraGear OLED 45 feels massive That’s bad thing size curve fully immerse games point remains however you’ll need lot desk space monitor 29 inches wide 25 inches tall highest point Thankfully standard 100mm x 100mm mount available back wallmount Jacob Roach Digital Trends Throwing UltraGear OLED 45 mount isn’t bad idea included stand doesn’t ton room adjustment isn’t Samsung Ark rotate display fully vertical Instead you’re given restrictive range 20 degrees swivel tilt minor adjustments though thankfully there’s generous 43 inches height adjustment Jacob Roach Digital Trends Outside ergonomics UltraGear OLED 45 looks fantastic features LG’s signature UltraGear vents back illuminate light back display options colors well rainbow cycle setting menu LG describes screen “virtually borderless” although thin bezel actual frame barely peaks around edge display monitor looks amazing you’re positioned correctly there’s nothing provides quite gaming experience main problem lack versatility design It’s bad option basic desktop use due aggressive curve it’s tough get engrossed movies due bowing around curve you’re sitting far back dilemma monitor TV Jacob Roach Digital Trends LG OLED 45 standard array ports — two HDMI 21 single DisplayPort 14 inputs along two USB 32 Gen 1 connections builtin USB hub Like LG monitors ports around back display rather underneath like Samsung Odyssey Neo G8 means connections stick bit monitor large it’s hardly issue isn’t standard audio access headphone jack supports DTS HeadphoneX virtual surround sound directly front display super handy also access optical audio jack behind monitor Although UltraGear OLED 45 unfortunately doesn’t include builtin speakers it’s easy enough hook pair PC speakers soundbar Ports great bone pick controlling monitor like UltraGear OLED 27 use included remote order access onscreen display OSD There’s standard array settings including color profiles can’t access full menu without remote Jacob Roach Digital Trends Instead button bottom display pulls quick access menu quickly adjust brightness turn monitor swap inputs problem button situations you’ll press dozen times turn brightness bit looked 27inch model problems screw covering battery slot remote also applies larger issue though there’s way control monitor apart remote it’s annoying timeconsuming painstakingly click quick access menu Low brightness worldclass image Jacob Roach Digital Trends There’s doubt OLED provides one best pictures get monitor right Wide color coverage perfect black levels pixels control brightness leads image that’s vibrant moody speeding past LCDs UltraGear OLED 45 isn’t different entering market that’s starting fill comes set issues starters it’s dim Similar UltraGear OLED 27 monitor tops around 200 nits brightness 3 window LG claims 1000 nits measured 780 Low brightness typical OLED although may cry foul notion dimmer monitor never dim work testing low brightness introduces issues nothing able see display lower brightness settings whites don’t appear white instead shadowed clear gray color would turn monitor around 75 brightness even get whites actually look white testing monitor locked 100 brightness Dim there’s doubt LG UltraGear OLED 45 beautiful extended color range measured 96 DCIP3 testing clocked color error 15 SDR That’s far better OLED panels I’ve tested like Asus ROG PG27AQDM though LG OLED 45 showed noticeable bump yellows we’ve seen past HDR color accuracy falls apart It’s way box doesn’t mean monitor looks bad clearly monitor built consumption creation bit color work SDR wouldn’t anything serious It’s built watching movies playing games exceptional job Assuming crank brightness there’s one issue image quality pixel density 445inch display resolution 3440 x 1440 leading pixel density around 83 pixels per inch PPI That’s around level 27inch 1080p monitor it’s big reason display like LG UltraGear OLED 48 hard justify doesn’t look nearly sharp something like Alienware 34 QDOLED due fact it’s much larger Normally you’d solve sitting back monitor aggressive 800R curve you’re clearly meant right action display It’s hard spot rough edges playing game kicking back watching movie browsing looking text screen isn’t super sharp OLED panel it’s important mention disclaimers There’s always small risk OLED burnin though hysteria surrounding OLED burnin bit overblown didn’t slightest hint image retention testing UltraGear OLED 45 automatically dim minutes inactivity also several panelsaving features LG includes automatic screensaver along pixelcleaning function keep panel looking clear cinematic gaming champ Jacob Roach Digital Trends There’s one word describe UltraGear OLED 45 comes gaming immersive 800R curve superaggressive envelopes experience playing it’s hard pull away you’re sucked game display built blockbuster cinematic games fantastic job It’s OLEDs I’ve reviewed though Similar LG’s 27inch model Asus’ OLED rival monitor comes 240Hz refresh rate due using OLED panel low response times leads exceptional motion clarity great play competitive games like Overwatch 2 Valorant Although that’s true paper wouldn’t recommend UltraGear OLED 45 types games 219 aspect ratio massive size steep curve playing competitive title always felt wrong always much screen take everything regardless great motion clarity really Jacob Roach Digital Trends UltraGear OLED 45 shines singleplayer experiences Games like Cyberpunk 2077 Marvel’s SpiderMan Horizon Zero Dawn look fantastic due large monitor feel like you’re getting sucked world UltraGear OLED 45 set singleplayer games I’m sure I’d ever leave desk Outside immersion excellent HDR UltraGear OLED 45 couple perks gaming starters it’s GSync Compatible certified FreeSync Premium you’re getting variable refresh rate regardless AMD Nvidia GPU addition comes headphone jack bottom support DTS HeadphoneX virtual surround sound get virtual surround sound plugging headset PC port right monitor handy LG even includes profiles tailored gaming watching movies gamer’s monitor 1 UltraGear OLED 45 operating full tilt there’s nothing like gaming experience cinematic titles engrossing won’t want stop playing Outside boundary though display becomes lot less practical It’s tough recommending general desktop work use due massive size OLED panel although size would normally make good option movies aggressive curve specific viewing distance kill mood also issues pixel density ultrawide like Alienware 34 QDOLED offering much better clarity despite sporting resolution Even problems UltraGear OLED 45 shoots past displays like Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 games providing immersive gaming experience displays can’t keep Editors Recommendations 3 upcoming gaming
