trying decide twin giants We’re going pit Android iOS several categories pick winner one However don’t go expecting black white answer Ultimately best platform depends — well — Pick things matter count wins categories personalized recommendation Affordability Google Pixel 4a 5G Google Apple always highend market terms pricing iPhone X took things whole new level starting price 1000 Apple’s iPhones haven’t gotten much cheaper since iPhone 12 Pro Max starts 1100 come little affordable much iPhone 12 starts 800 iPhone SE 2020 — cheapest iPhone Apple sells — starts 400 Apple continues expand offerings 400 cheap gets unless delve secondhand market sheer scale variety nothing competes Android spend lot want — example Samsung’s cuttingedge folding Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G costs 2000 there’s also huge selection good lowcost handsets low 100 wide variety different manufacturers platform also deliberately optimized run lowend hardware introduction variant OS Android Go Finally Android’s lead free apps also makes natural choice budgetconscious Apple’s iOS exceptional OS high entry point always one biggest issues Apple’s iPhone SE iPhone 12 make entry point lower it’s still match Android’s massive range affordable devices Whether you’re looking spend 100 2000 there’s Android phone iOS can’t say Winner Android Apps Let’s start look numbers roughly many apps you’ll find Google Play Store Apple App Store Android apps 27 million iOS apps 182 million However numbers aren’t best metric us use handful apps popular ones available platforms Traditionally iOS lucrative platform developers tendency new apps appear first that’s changing Android’s market share continues grow US iOS still leads way developers elsewhere increasingly targeting Android first Luckily operating systems taking precautions comes malicious apps spyware making apps safer download ever Play Store still higher percentage free apps App Store best mobile games still land iOS first — don’t always come Android even Android plenty great games Ultimately quality beats quantity narrow win iOS Winner iOS App Store It’s difficult organize millions apps games neither Google’s Play Store Apple’s App Store perfectly Overall think Apple’s App Store provides better browsing experience phone better job curated recommendations Play Store easier search queue install apps web browser PC laptop like fact buy apps using fingerprint via Touch ID iPhones set thing Play Store Android phones fingerprint sensors Play Store wins points noquibble refund policy within two hours purchase questionable apps stores Apple generally stricter blocking certain types apps good thing overall quality it’s bad thing you’re something like game emulators classic consoles iOS App Store edges win usability curated content Winner iOS Alternative app stores sideloading It’s relatively easy sideload apps Android Tick box settings download APK you’re set also lot alternative Android app stores beyond Play Store sideloading open risk malware isn’t worth worrying people Apple opposed thirdparty app stores want access you’ll jailbreak iPhone want wider choice apps easy sideloading winner obvious Winner Android Maps Greg MombertDigital Trends newer navigation system Apple Maps great start improved significantly Key features similar download maps offline use get accurate estimates based current traffic conditions find turnbyturn directions driving walking Apple even closed Google Maps adding cycling directions improvements iOS 14 You’ll also find public transit ridebooking integration work well get you’re going used Google Maps would win category handsdown — it’s still generally map app choice Apple made huge strides toward parity last years Apple Maps point it’s serious competitor would still personally download Google Maps even iOS device chose go Apple’s map app Google’s wouldn’t getting inferior product Right Google Maps still small advantage due larger database reviews businesses lead narrowed lot expect see category fall tie eventually Winner Android Battery life charging one biggest complaints smartphone owners battery life huge factor It’s difficult compare two platforms there’s common hardware iOS optimized squeeze battery per mAh rating buy Android device much bigger battery easily outlast iPhone Android iOS allow see battery usage glance broken app Android shows estimate much battery life left offer powersaving modes extend battery life limiting performance connectivity powersapping features precisely works generally customizable Android long time Android advantage charging department many Android phones offered fastcharging capabilities wireless charging However Apple’s iPhone 11 iPhone X even iPhone SE 2020 adopted wireless charging fast charging they’re far behind It’s worth noting buy fastcharging adapter separately iPhone models whereas it’s usually provided box Android phone Apple supplied fast charger iPhone 11 Pro one last iPhones come charger iPhone 12 onwards you’ll buy charger separately iPhones come LightningtoUSBC cable However Android fans shouldn’t sneer iPhone lovers much Samsung following Apple led new Galaxy S21 range comes charger box headphone jack we’ll probably start see change echo across manufacturers category far clearcut comparing similarly priced Android phones iPhones find phone larger battery that’s important tend fast chargers included box moment Android gets win Winner Android Updates Apple’s iOS offers consistent timely software updates security patches want experience Android buy one Google’s Pixel phones phone running Android One iOS version shares break according official Apple Developer website iOS 14 80 iOS 13 12 Earlier 8 around 80 iOS devices running latest version numbers even better look devices introduced last four years devices 86 run iOS 14 12 run iOS 13 2 run earlier version iOS That’s impressive Android similar standard Android 11 available don’t expect spread majority devices Android stats come Android Studio don’t seem updated often Apple’s iOS distribution numbers Android 11’s distribution stats seem wouldn’t expect move double digits Heck according Android Studio it’s struggling hit single percentage point Android 11 1 Android 10 82 Android 90 Pie 313 Android 81 Oreo 14 Android 80 Oreo 73 Android 711 Nougat 54 Android 70 Nougat 75 Android 60 Marshmallow 112 Android 51 Lollipop 74 Android 50 Lollipop 18 Android 44 KitKat 4 Older 19 notable exceptions Google’s Pixel phones running Android One like many Nokia’s phones want latest features bug fixes security updates choose iOS Winner iOS Customizability Greg MombertDigital Trends always one Android’s main strengths It’s easy customize phone — set layout want home screen add widgets shortcuts even change entire user interface launchers iOS 14 something revolution iPhone users introducing far support widgets iOS home screen initially seems like bit fun users taken advantage widgetcustomizing apps dramatically change look devices However it’s still level Android allows thirdparty launchers completely change phone something else entirely want phone embraces tinkering truly unique personalized look home screen Android platform Winner Android Accessibility perception Android complicated iOS prevails there’s need dive customization options platforms offer good range accessibility features you’re looking device elderly relative technophobe you’ll find specialist offerings Android tend scale what’s possible Manufacturers like Samsung also include options like “Easy mode” makes interface bigger simplifies whole experience opt thirdparty app lots good apps aimed elderly Android iOS regardless Ultimately iOS simpler easier use important ways It’s uniform across iOS devices whereas Android slightly different devices different manufacturers also think iOS less cluttered streamlined Android phones although Google’s stock Android every bit elegant accessible Android come long way old days it’s still accessible iOS’s simple interface iOS wins Winner iOS Calls messaging Greg MombertDigital Trends Basic calling messaging functionality good platforms confusing Android First Google appeared folding everything Hangouts allows messages SMS video chat group chat via WiFi data network released Allo Duo retiring Hangouts — wait also shut Allo well Messages default texting app seems Google’s main messaging app received RCS support However you’ll find many manufacturers like offer alternatives Many Android phones come messaging dialer apps addition Google’s messaging apps making whole confusing situation even worse iOS controlled directly Apple lot simpler FaceTime iMessage come preinstalled every iPhone iPad it’s remarkably easy connect friends family iMessage easy use works best communicating iPhone users creating culture blue versus green bubbles You’ll find thirdparty app integration fun stickers GIFs much iMessage give iOS win consistency ease use Winner iOS Email default email apps Android iOS easy use quick set pull multiple email accounts view single inbox desire Android iOS huge range thirdparty email apps available well However Gmail stronger default email app iOS’ Mail Since Gmail popular email address system world makes sense Gmail app would winner also add email addresses different providers Gmail ease intuitiveness app Google Suite apps sets apart rest issue Android phones often offer alternative email apps made manufacturers may may good Winner Android Camera Greg MombertDigital Trends difficult category call past we’ve argued Apple best job capturing lighting coloring details latest Android smartphones casting lot doubt assertion Google’s Pixel 5 boasts excellent camera iPhone 12 Pro Max current crop Android flagships sport good sometimes great cameras there’s fair bit variance camera quality many midrange devices doesn’t come close quality iPhone cameras you’d expect budget Android phones lowerquality cameras camera apps platforms good fast ease use best results without tweaking iOS camera app takes cake There’s variation Android simply manufacturers tend add camera apps lots features good bit gimmicky used grant one iOS pure consistency despite strengths phones like Google’s Pixel Samsung’s Galaxy However times moved lot Android manufacturers put fight Apple’s excellent cameras tie Winner Tie Photo backup use Photos app Android automatically back photos videos back photos videos original resolution iCloud Google Photos get 5GB free space iCloud compared 15GB Google category complicated fact default iOS iCloud also use Google’s Photos iOS However since people go default option we’re giving Android win Winner Android Cloud services Apple still lagging comes cloud storage automatic backups Google offers 15GB free crossplatform support get 5GB iCloud works Windows Mac iOS need lot additional space Google One charges 2 per month 100GB 20 year Apple charges 1 per month 50GB 3 per month 200GB Apple’s price 2TB jumps 10 per month Google also give 2TB price get discount pay year costs 100 833 per month Android’s cloud storage easier use effective iCloud also use Google Drive iPhone whereas iCloud iOS Winner Android Voice assistants Chris DeGrawDigital Trends many things Apple’s Siri Google Assistant Siri like straightforward helper setting calendar appointments searching web making calls Google Assistant extra layer preemptively offer useful suggestions conversational side offers entertaining games contextual information based you’re It’s smarter versatile Siri addition Siri Shortcuts iOS 12 allows set voice commands trigger groups automated tasks big step right direction Siri also beginning make suggestions based iPhone usage however Google Assistant seems improving much faster rate offering things like call screening ability make reservations Winner Android Security Much made supposedly “toxic hell stew” Android threat malware exaggerated truth people never encounter problem don’t go outside Play Store apps Specific manufacturers like Samsung taken extra efforts beef security enterprise market slovenly nature updates many Android devices seriously delay important security patches Speedy updates important ever security breaches becoming serious Android tends lag update world — unless stock Android device like Pixel phone running Android One lack update speed tends mean Android less secure emerging threats millions Android phones still running software that’s years old vulnerable serious hacks like Heartbleed Stagefright Apple firmly entrenched corporate America also worked improved security general consumers notably Touch ID FaceID iPhone X later tight oversight Apple apps ability push updates devices quickly gives edge Android company also encrypts data iMessage apps Apple prioritizes user privacy feel safe knowing personal data stored read Apple encrypted Meanwhile Android encrypts data privacy less protected Google mines data information use sell better ads market products data also stored read provide better AI experience Google claims committed fully protect user privacy still provide AI services offers security experts Apple argue Google presents false choice AI privacy Apple even went war FBI guarantee right encryption It’s hard beat kind dedication There’s denying iOS secure platform one best protects user privacy care privacy security go iPhone Winner iOS Rooting bootloaders jailbreaking We’ve looked root Android phone tablet It’s everyone want root access complete control device rooting way get Rooting gives access apps latest OS updates without waiting new software skins get aesthetic want chance get rid bloatware carriers manufacturers potential tweaks boost device’s speed battery life Many Android OEMs original equipment manufacturers also offer way unlock bootloader determines OS loads device Apple completely opposed kind thing Jailbreaking option iOS lets download install apps outside App Store bypass limitations Winner Android Cases accessories average iPad iPhone owner spends money things average Android device owner Apple built great ecosystem peripherals phones tablets far peripherals cases aimed iPhone device major flagship like Samsung Galaxy S21 would close second hand Android devices adopted Micro USB USBC standard whereas Apple insists proprietary Lightning cable means it’s much easier find charger you’re iPhone owner often means splash overpriced Apple adapter Peripheral manufacturers may still go iOS main target it’s rare find something without Micro USB USBC support Another mark Apple abandonment standard 35mm audio port begun iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus get adapter box new iPhone Apple longer includes you’ll buy dongle even it’s easily lost choice headphones sporting 35mm audio jacks far exceeds Lightning connectors course Android phones continue ax headphone jack favor USBC Bluetooth audio lessening point Apple It’s also important note Apple’s ecosystem products work together exceedingly well iPad Apple Watch MacBook HomeKit products work together perfect harmony MacOS WatchOS iPadOS iOS well connected making easy Apple products page you’re already invested MacBook iPad iPhone would allow devices work well together Since Android phones produced many different manufacturers product ecosystems vary Samsung great ecosystem example Android phones support Home Chromecast Wear OS However it’s quite seamless Apple Overall taking available accessories account choice iPhone iOS takes win caveats Winner iOS Conclusion Numerically speaking Android wins 10 categories iOS wins seven iOS wins important categories — don’t think rooting alternative app stores important people accessibility security example However it’s difficult compare two Apple controls hardware software devices you’ll find iOS offers uniform experience across devices straight comparison latest versions Android iOS wouldn’t representative people’s experience Android devices aren’t running latest version experience get complicated fact Android smartphone manufacturers add user interface top Google’s stock Android result there’s quite big difference using Google’s Pixel 5 Samsung
