A search engine system is a software tool designed to help users find information on the internet.
There are various search engine systems available that cater to different purposes.
An example of a specific purpose of a search engine system is to provide news search assistance.
These types of search engines are tailored to help find up-to-date, accurate, and relevant news articles quickly and easily.
They would allow users to search for specific news topics by location, title, keywords, and other relevant criteria.

One of the key features of a news search engine system is its ability to use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to group and rank news articles based on their relevance and reliability. 
Allowing users to quickly and easily find the most credible and informative news articles on a particular topic, without having to sift through irrelevant or biased content. 
Additionally, many news search engine systems offer personalized recommendations and alerts based on users' search histories and preferences, helping users stay informed about the latest developments in their areas of interest.

Welcome to our search engine designed specifically for all things Technology, Health, and Entertainment! 
We have utilized various components from our knowledge in this course to create a basic search engine that delivers fast, accurate, and reliable results. 
By calling upon our Python script ‘searchengine.py’ users unlock a simple and intuitive program that allows them to crawl new webpages, index documents, search for a query, train an ML classifier, and predict a link all no more than a couple of keyboard taps and mouse clicks away! 
Our search engine scours webpages for all the relevant information on Technology, Health, and Entertainment, extracting the available data and organizing it into folders and files tucked right in your back pocket for future use. 
Whenever you're ready, you can take it back out and turn it into an inverted index, this data structure allows you to efficiently search for specific keywords or phrases. 
But it doesn't stop there! 
With the help of machine learning algorithms, our search engine can classify webpages based on their content, by vectorizing and analyzing the content our classifying features can determine to whether a webpages' main topic is Technology, Health, or Entertainment and store it all within arms reach! 
Additionally, this classifier allows you to supply any link your heart desires and our search engine will supply you with the most relevant and related topic as well as how accurate categorization is right to down to a percentage. 
With the use of machine learning techniques, our search engine will continually improve the accuracy and relevance of our search results, the sky is the limit! 
In conclusion, our search engine system for Technology, Health, and Entertainment is developed to provide users with fast, accurate, and reliable classifications on these three important topics. 
We have leveraged our knowledge from this course to design the various components of our system, including web crawling, indexing, tokenizing, and machine learning, to ensure that our users receive the best possible search experience!
